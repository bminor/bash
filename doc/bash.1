.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Bash
is an \fBsh\fR-compatible command language interpreter that
executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.
.B Bash
also incorporates useful features from the \fIKorn\fP and \fIC\fP
shells (\fBksh\fP and \fBcsh\fP).
.PP
.B Bash
is ultimately intended to be a conformant implementation of the IEEE
POSIX Shell and Tools specification (IEEE Working Group 1003\.2).
.SH OPTIONS
In addition to the single-character shell options documented in the
description of the \fBset\fR builtin command, \fBbash\fR
interprets the following flags when it is invoked:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP 10
.BI \-c "\| string\^"
If the
.B \-c
flag is present, then commands are read from
.IR string .
If there are arguments after the
.IR string ,
they are assigned to the positional parameters, starting with
.BR $0 .
.TP
.B \-r
If the
.B \-r
flag is present, the shell becomes
.I restricted
(see
.SM
.B "RESTRICTED SHELL"
below).
.TP
.B \-i
If the
.B \-i
flag is present, the shell is
.IR interactive .
.TP
.B \-s
If the
.B \-s
flag is present, or if no arguments remain after option
processing, then commands are read from the standard input.
This option allows the positional parameters to be set
when invoking an interactive shell.
.TP
.B \-D
A list of all double-quoted strings preceded by \fB$\fP
is printed on the standard ouput.
These are the strings that
are subject to language translation when the current locale
is not C or POSIX.
This implies the \fB\-n\fP option; no commands will be executed.
.TP
.B \-\-
A
.B \-\-
signals the end of options and disables further option processing.
Any arguments after the
.B \-\-
are treated as filenames and arguments.  An argument of
.B \-
is equivalent to \fB\-\-\fP.
.PD
.PP
.B Bash
also interprets a number of multi-character options.
These options must appear on the command line before the
single-character options in order for them to be recognized.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.B \-\-dump\-strings
Equivalent to \fB\-D\fP.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Display a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.
.TP
.B \-\-login
Make
.B bash
act as if it had been invoked as a login shell (see
.SM
.B INVOCATION
below).
.TP
.B \-\-noediting
Do not use the GNU
.B readline
library to read command lines if interactive.
.TP
.B \-\-noprofile
Do not read either the system-wide startup file
.FN /etc/profile
or any of the personal initialization files
.IR ~/.bash_profile ,
.IR ~/.bash_login ,
or
.IR ~/.profile .
By default,
.B bash
reads these files when it is invoked as a login shell (see
.SM
.B INVOCATION
below).
.TP
.B \-\-norc
Do not read and execute the personal initialization file
.I ~/.bashrc
if the shell is interactive.
This option is on by default if the shell is invoked as
.BR sh .
.TP
.B \-\-posix
Change the behavior of \fBbash\fP where the default operation differs
from the POSIX 1003.2 standard to match the standard.
.TP
\fB\-\-rcfile\fP \fIfile\fP
Execute commands from
.I file
instead of the standard personal initialization file
.I ~/.bashrc
if the shell is interactive (see
.SM
.B INVOCATION
below).
.TP
.B \-\-restricted
The shell becomes restricted (see
.SM
.B "RESTRICTED SHELL"
below).
.TP
.B \-\-verbose
Equivalent to  \fB\-v\fP.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Show version information for this instance of
.B bash
on the standard output and exit successfully.
.PD
.SH ARGUMENTS
If arguments remain after option processing, and neither the
.B \-c
nor the
.B \-s
option has been supplied, the first argument is assumed to
be the name of a file containing shell commands.
If
.B bash
is invoked in this fashion, 
.B $0
is set to the name of the file, and the positional parameters
are set to the remaining arguments.
.B Bash
reads and executes commands from this file, then exits.
\fBBash\fP's exit status is the exit status of the last command
executed in the script.
If no commands are executed, the exit status is 0.
.SH INVOCATION
A \fIlogin shell\fP is one whose first character of argument zero is a
.BR \- ,
or one started with the 
.B \-\-login
option.
.PP
An \fIinteractive\fP shell is one whose standard input and output are
both connected to terminals (as determined by
.IR isatty (3)),
or one started with the
.B \-i
option.
.SM
.B PS1
is set and
.B $\-
includes
.B i
if
.B bash
is interactive,
allowing a shell script or a startup file to test this state.
.PP
The following paragraphs describe how
.B bash
executes its startup files.
If any of the files exist but cannot be read,
.B bash
reports an error.
Tildes are expanded in file names as described below under
.B "Tilde Expansion"
in the
.SM
.B EXPANSION
section.
.PP
When
.B bash
is invoked as an interactive login shell, it first reads and
executes commands from the file \fI/etc/profile\fP, if that
file exists.
After reading that file, it looks for \fI~/.bash_profile\fP,
\fI~/.bash_login\fP, and \fI~/.profile\fP, in that order, and reads
and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable.
The
.B \-\-noprofile
option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.
.PP
When a login shell exits,
.B bash
reads and executes commands from the file \fI~/.bash_logout\fP, if it
exists.
.PP
When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started,
.B bash
reads and executes commands from \fI~/.bashrc\fP, if that file exists.
This may be inhibited by using the
.B \-\-norc
option.
The \fB\-\-rcfile\fP \fIfile\fP option will force
.B bash
to read and execute commands from \fIfile\fP instead of \fI~/.bashrc\fP.
.PP
When
.B bash
is started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for example, it
looks for the variable
.SM
.B BASH_ENV
in the environment, expands its value if it appears there, and uses the
expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute.
.B Bash
behaves as if the following command were executed:
.sp .5
.RS
\f(CWif [ \-n "$BASH_ENV" ]; then . "$BASH_ENV"; fi\fP
.RE
.sp .5
but the value of the
.SM
.B PATH
variable is not used to search for the file name.
.PP
If
.B bash
is invoked with the name
.BR sh ,
it tries to mimic the startup behavior of historical versions of
.B sh
as closely as possible,
while conforming to the POSIX standard as well.
When invoked as a login shell, it first attempts to read and execute
commands from
.I /etc/profile
and
.IR ~/.profile ,
in that order.
The
.B \-\-noprofile
option may be used to inhibit this behavior.
When invoked as an interactive shell with the name
.BR sh ,
.B bash
looks for the variable
.SM
.BR ENV ,
expands its value if it is defined, and uses the
expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute.
Since a shell invoked as
.B sh
does not attempt to read and execute commands from any other startup
files, the
.B \-\-rcfile
option has no effect.
A non-interactive shell invoked with the name
.B sh
does not attempt to read any startup files. 
When invoked as
.BR sh ,
.B bash
enters
.I posix
mode after the startup files are read.
.PP
When
.B bash
is started in
.I posix
mode, as with the
.B \-\-posix
command line option, it follows the POSIX standard for startup files.
In this mode, the
.SM
.B ENV
variable is expanded and commands are read and executed from the file
whose name is the expanded value.
No other startup files are read.
This is done by interactive shells only.
.PP
.B Bash
attempts to determine when it is being run by the remote shell
daemon, usually \fIrshd\fP.
If
.B bash
determines it is being run by \fIrshd\fP, it reads and executes
commands from \fI~/.bashrc\fP, if that file exists and is readable.
It will not do this if invoked as \fBsh\fP.
The
.B \-\-norc
option may be used to inhibit this behavior, and the
.B \-\-rcfile
option may be used to force another file to be read, but
\fIrshd\fP does not generally invoke the shell with those options
or allow them to be specified.
.SH DEFINITIONS
.PP
The following definitions are used throughout the rest of this
document.
.PD 0
.TP
.B blank 
A space or tab.
.TP
.B word
A sequence of characters considered as a single unit by the shell.
Also known as a
.BR token .
.TP
.B name
A 
.I word
consisting only of alphanumeric characters and underscores, and
beginning with an alphabetic character or an underscore.  Also
referred to as an
.BR identifier .
.TP
.B metacharacter
A character that, when unquoted, separates words.  One of the following:
.br
.RS
.PP
.if t \fB|  &  ;  (  )  <  >  space  tab\fP
.if n \fB|  & ; ( ) < > space tab\fP
.RE
.PP
.TP
.B control operator
A \fItoken\fP that performs a control function.  It is one of the following
symbols:
.RS
.PP
.if t \fB\(bv\(bv  &  &&  ;  ;;  (  )  |  <newline>\fP
.if n \fB|| & && ; ;; ( ) | <newline>\fP
.RE
.PD
.SH "RESERVED WORDS"
\fIReserved words\fP are words that have a special meaning to the shell.
The following words are recognized as reserved when unquoted and either
the first word of a simple command (see
.SM
.B SHELL GRAMMAR
below) or the third word of a 
.B case 
or
.B for
command:
.if t .RS
.PP
.B
.if n ! case  do done elif else esac fi for function if in select then until while { } time
.if t !    case    do    done    elif    else    esac    fi    for    function    if    in    select    then    until    while    {    }    time
.if t .RE
.RE
.SH "SHELL GRAMMAR"
.SS Simple Commands
.PP
A \fIsimple command\fP is a sequence of optional variable assignments
followed by \fBblank\fP-separated words and redirections, and
terminated by a \fIcontrol operator\fP.  The first word
specifies the command to be executed.  The remaining words are
passed as arguments to the invoked command.
.PP
The return value of a \fIsimple command\fP is its exit status, or
128+\fIn\^\fP if the command is terminated by signal
.IR n .
.SS Pipelines
.PP
A \fIpipeline\fP is a sequence of one or more commands separated by
the character
.BR | .
The format for a pipeline is:
.RS
.PP
[\fBtime\fP [\fB\-p\fP]] [ ! ] \fIcommand\fP [ \fB|\fP \fIcommand2\fP ... ]
.RE
.PP
The standard output of
.I command
is connected to the standard input of
.IR command2 .
This connection is performed before any redirections specified by the
command (see
.SM
.B REDIRECTION
below).
.PP
If the reserved word
.B !
precedes a pipeline, the exit status of that
pipeline is the logical NOT of the exit status of the last command.
Otherwise, the status of the pipeline is the exit status of the last
command.
The shell waits for all commands in the pipeline to
terminate before returning a value.
.PP
If the
.B time
reserved word precedes a pipeline, the elapsed as well as user and
system time consumed by its execution are reported when the pipeline
terminates.
The \fB\-p\fP option changes the output format to that specified by POSIX.
The
.SM
.B TIMEFORMAT
variable may be set to a format string that specifies how the timing
information should be displayed; see the description of
.SM
.B TIMEFORMAT
under
.B "Shell Variables"
below.
.PP
Each command in a pipeline is executed as a separate process (i.e., in a
subshell).
.SS Lists
.PP
A \fIlist\fP is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one
of the operators
.BR ; ,
.BR & ,
.BR && ,
or
.BR \(bv\(bv ,
and optionally terminated by one of
.BR ; ,
.BR & ,
or
.BR <newline> .
.PP
Of these list operators,
.B &&
and
.B \(bv\(bv
have equal precedence, followed by
.B ;
and
.BR &,
which have equal precedence.
.PP
If a command is terminated by the control operator
.BR & ,
the shell executes the command in the \fIbackground\fP
in a subshell.  The shell does not wait for the command to
finish, and the return status is 0.  Commands separated by a
.B ;
are executed sequentially; the shell waits for each
command to terminate in turn.  The return status is the
exit status of the last command executed.
.PP
The control operators
.B &&
and
.B \(bv\(bv
denote AND lists and OR lists, respectively.
An AND list has the form
.RS
.PP
\fIcommand\fP \fB&&\fP \fIcommand2\fP
.RE
.PP
.I command2
is executed if, and only if,
.I command
returns an exit status of zero.
.PP
An OR list has the form
.RS
.PP
\fIcommand\fP \fB\(bv\(bv\fP \fIcommand2\fP
.PP
.RE
.PP
.I command2
is executed if and only if
.I command
returns a non-zero exit status.  The return status of
AND and OR lists is the exit status of the last command
executed in the list.
.SS Compound Commands
.PP
A \fIcompound command\fP is one of the following:
.TP
(\fIlist\fP)
\fIlist\fP is executed in a subshell.  Variable assignments and builtin
commands that affect the shell's environment do not remain in effect
after the command completes.  The return status is the exit status of
\fIlist\fP.
.TP
{ \fIlist\fP; }
\fIlist\fP is simply executed in the current shell environment.
\fIlist\fP must be terminated with a newline or semicolon.
This is known as a \fIgroup command\fP.
The return status is the exit status of
\fIlist\fP.
.TP
((\fIexpression\fP))
The \fIexpression\fP is evaluated according to the rules described
below under
.SM
.BR "ARITHMETIC EVALUATION" .
If the value of the expression is non-zero, the return status is 0;
otherwise the return status is 1.  This is exactly equivalent to
\fBlet "\fIexpression\fP"\fR.
.TP
\fBfor\fP \fIname\fP [ \fBin\fP \fIword\fP; ] \fBdo\fP \fIlist\fP ; \fBdone\fP
The list of words following \fBin\fP is expanded, generating a list
of items.  The variable \fIname\fP is set to each element of this list
in turn, and \fIlist\fP is executed each time.  If the \fBin\fP
\fIword\fP is omitted, the \fBfor\fP command executes \fIlist\fP 
once for each positional parameter that is set (see
.SM
.B PARAMETERS
below).
.TP
\fBselect\fP \fIname\fP [ \fBin\fP \fIword\fP; ] \fBdo\fP \fIlist\fP ; \fBdone\fP
The list of words following \fBin\fP is expanded, generating a list
of items.  The set of expanded words is printed on the standard
error, each preceded by a number.  If the \fBin\fP
\fIword\fP is omitted, the positional parameters are printed (see
.SM
.B PARAMETERS
below).  The
.B PS3
prompt is then displayed and a line read from the standard input.
If the line consists of a number corresponding to one of
the displayed words, then the value of
.I name
is set to that word.  If the line is empty, the words and prompt
are displayed again.  If EOF is read, the command completes.  Any
other value read causes
.I name
to be set to null.  The line read is saved in the variable
.BR REPLY .
The
.I list
is executed after each selection until a
.B break
or
.B return
command is executed.
The exit status of
.B select
is the exit status of the last command executed in
.IR list ,
or zero if no commands were executed.
.TP
\fBcase\fP \fIword\fP \fBin\fP [ ( \fIpattern\fP [ \fB|\fP \fIpattern\fP ] \
... ) \fIlist\fP ;; ] ... \fBesac\fP
A \fBcase\fP command first expands \fIword\fP, and tries to match
it against each \fIpattern\fP in turn, using the same matching rules
as for pathname expansion (see
.B Pathname Expansion
below).  When a match is found, the
corresponding \fIlist\fP is executed.  After the first match, no
subsequent matches are attempted.  The exit status is zero if no
pattern matches.  Otherwise, it is the exit status of the
last command executed in \fIlist\fP.
.TP
\fBif\fP \fIlist\fP; \fBthen\fP \fIlist;\fP \
[ \fBelif\fP \fIlist\fP; \fBthen\fP \fIlist\fP; ] ... \
[ \fBelse\fP \fIlist\fP; ] \fBfi\fP
The
.B if 
.I list
is executed.  If its exit status is zero, the
\fBthen\fP \fIlist\fP is executed.  Otherwise, each \fBelif\fP
\fIlist\fP is executed in turn, and if its exit status is zero,
the corresponding \fBthen\fP \fIlist\fP is executed and the
command completes.  Otherwise, the \fBelse\fP \fIlist\fP is
executed, if present.  The exit status is the exit status of the
last command executed, or zero if no condition tested true.
.TP
.PD 0
\fBwhile\fP \fIlist\fP; \fBdo\fP \fIlist\fP; \fBdone\fP
.TP
\fBuntil\fP \fIlist\fP; \fBdo\fP \fIlist\fP; \fBdone\fP
.PD
The \fBwhile\fP command continuously executes the \fBdo\fP
\fIlist\fP as long as the last command in \fIlist\fP returns
an exit status of zero.  The \fBuntil\fP command is identical
to the \fBwhile\fP command, except that the test is negated;
the
.B do
.I list
is executed as long as the last command in
.I list
returns a non-zero exit status.
The exit status of the \fBwhile\fP and \fBuntil\fP commands
is the exit status
of the last \fBdo\fP \fIlist\fP command executed, or zero if
none was executed.
.TP
[ \fBfunction\fP ] \fIname\fP () { \fIlist\fP; }
This defines a function named \fIname\fP.  The \fIbody\fP of the
function is the
.I list
of commands between { and }.  This list
is executed whenever \fIname\fP is specified as the
name of a simple command.  The exit status of a function is
the exit status of the last command executed in the body.  (See
.SM
.B FUNCTIONS
below.)
.SH COMMENTS
In a non-interactive shell, or an interactive shell in which the
.B interactive_comments
option to the
.B shopt
builtin is enabled (see
.SM
.B "SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS"
below), a word beginning with
.B #
causes that word and all remaining characters on that line to
be ignored.  An interactive shell without the
.B interactive_comments
.B shopt
option enabled does not allow comments.  The
.B interactive_comments
option is on by default in interactive shells.
.SH QUOTING
\fIQuoting\fP is used to remove the special meaning of certain
characters or words to the shell.  Quoting can be used to 
disable special treatment for special characters, to prevent
reserved words from being recognized as such, and to prevent
parameter expansion.
.PP
Each of the \fImetacharacters\fP listed above under
.SM
.B DEFINITIONS
has special meaning to the shell and must be quoted if they are to
represent themselves.  There are three quoting mechanisms: the
.IR "escape character" ,
single quotes, and double quotes.
.PP
A non-quoted backslash (\fB\e\fP) is the
.IR "escape character" .
It preserves the literal value of the next character that follows,
with the exception of <newline>.  If a \fB\e\fP<newline> pair
appears, and the backslash is not quoted, the \fB\e\fP<newline>
is treated as a line continuation (that is, it is effectively ignored).
.PP
Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal value
of each character within the quotes.  A single quote may not occur
between single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash.
.PP
Enclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal value
of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of
.BR $ ,
.BR ` ,
and
.BR \e .
The characters
.B $
and
.B `
retain their special meaning within double quotes.  The backslash
retains its special meaning only when followed by one of the following
characters:
.BR $ ,
.BR ` ,
\^\fB"\fP\^,
.BR \e ,
or
.BR <newline> .
A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding it with
a backslash.
.PP
The special parameters
.B *
and
.B @
have special meaning when in double
quotes (see
.SM
.B PARAMETERS
below).
.PP
Words of the form \fB$\fP'\fIstring\fP' are treated specially.  The
word expands to \fIstring\fP, with backslash-escaped characters replaced
as specifed by the ANSI C standard.  Backslash escape sequences, if
present, are decoded as follows:
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B \ea
alert (bell)
.TP
.B \eb
backspace
.TP
.B \ee
an escape character
.TP   
.B \ef
form feed
.TP  
.B \en
new line
.TP     
.B \er
carriage return
.TP
.B \et
horizontal tab
.TP   
.B \ev
vertical tab
.TP
.B \e\e
backslash
.TP   
.B \e\fInnn\fP
the character whose ASCII code is \fInnn\fP (octal)
.PD
.RE
.LP
The translated result is single-quoted, as if the dollar sign had
not been present.
.PP
A double-quoted string preceded by a dollar sign (\fB$\fP) will cause
the string to be translated according to the current locale.
If the current locale is \fBC\fP or \fBPOSIX\fP, the dollar sign
is ignored.
If the string is translated and replaced, the replacement is
double-quoted.
.SH PARAMETERS
A
.I parameter
is an entity that stores values.
It can be a
.IR name ,
a number, or one of the special characters listed below under
.BR "Special Parameters" .
For the shell's purposes, a
.I variable
is a parameter denoted by a
.IR name .
.PP
A parameter is set if it has been assigned a value.  The null string is
a valid value.  Once a variable is set, it may be unset only by using
the
.B unset
builtin command (see
.SM
.B SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
below).
.PP
A
.I variable
may be assigned to by a statement of the form
.RS
.PP
\fIname\fP=[\fIvalue\fP]
.RE
.PP
If
.I value
is not given, the variable is assigned the null string.  All
.I values
undergo tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, string
expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote
removal (see
.SM
.B EXPANSION
below).  If the variable has its
.B \-i
attribute set (see
.B declare
below in
.SM
.BR "SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS" )
then
.I value
is subject to arithmetic expansion even if the $((...)) syntax does
not appear (see
.B "Arithmetic Expansion"
below).
Word splitting is not performed, with the exception
of \fB"$@"\fP as explained below under
.BR "Special Parameters" .
Pathname expansion is not performed.
.SS Positional Parameters
.PP
A
.I positional parameter
is a parameter denoted by one or more
digits, other than the single digit 0.  Positional parameters are
assigned from the shell's arguments when it is invoked,
and may be reassigned using the
.B set
builtin command.  Positional parameters may not be assigned to
with assignment statements.  The positional parameters are
temporarily replaced when a shell function is executed (see
.SM
.B FUNCTIONS
below).
.PP
When a positional parameter consisting of more than a single
digit is expanded, it must be enclosed in braces (see
.SM
.B EXPANSION
below).
.SS Special Parameters
.PP
The shell treats several parameters specially.  These parameters may
only be referenced; assignment to them is not allowed.
.PD 0
.TP
.B *
Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one.  When the
expansion occurs within double quotes, it expands to a single word
with the value of each parameter separated by the first character
of the 
.SM
.B IFS
special variable.  That is, ``\fB$*\fP'' is equivalent
to ``\fB$1\fP\fIc\fP\fB$2\fP\fIc\fP\fB...\fP'', where
.I c
is the first character of the value of the
.SM
.B IFS
variable.  If
.SM
.B IFS
is unset, the parameters are separated by spaces.
If
.SM
.B IFS
is null, the parameters are joined without intervening separators.
.TP
.B @
Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one.  When the
expansion occurs within double quotes, each parameter expands as a
separate word.  That is, ``
.BR $@ ''
is equivalent to
``\fB$1\fP'' ``\fB$2\fP'' ...
When there are no positional parameters, ``\fB$@\fP'' and 
.B $@
expand to nothing (i.e., they are removed).
.TP
.B #
Expands to the number of positional parameters in decimal.
.TP
.B ?
Expands to the status of the most recently executed foreground
pipeline.
.TP
.B \-
Expands to the current option flags as specified upon invocation, 
by the
.B set
builtin command, or those set by the shell itself
(such as the
.B \-i
flag).
.TP
.B $
Expands to the process ID of the shell.  In a () subshell, it
expands to the process ID of the current shell, not the
subshell.
.TP
.B !
Expands to the process ID of the most recently executed background
(asynchronous) command.
.TP
.B 0
Expands to the name of the shell or shell script.  This is set at
shell initialization.  If
.B bash
is invoked with a file of commands,
.B $0
is set to the name of that file.  If
.B bash
is started with the
.B \-c
option, then
.B $0
is set to the first argument after the string to be
executed, if one is present.  Otherwise, it is set
to the file name used to invoke
.BR bash ,
as given by argument zero.
.TP
.B _
At shell startup, set to the absolute file name of the shell or shell
script being executed as passed in the argument list.
Subsequently, expands to the last argument to the previous command,
after expansion.
Also set to the full file name of each command executed and placed in
the environment exported to that command.
When checking mail, this parameter holds the name of the mail file
currently being checked.
.PD
.SS Shell Variables
.PP
The following variables are set by the shell:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.B PPID
The process ID of the shell's parent.
.TP

.B cd
command.
.TP
.B OLDPWD
The previous working directory as set by the
.B cd
command.
.TP
.B REPLY
Set to the line of input read by the
.B read
builtin command when no arguments are supplied.
.TP
.B UID
Expands to the user ID of the current user, initialized at shell startup.
.TP
.B EUID
Expands to the effective user ID of the current user, initialized at
shell startup.
.TP

An array variable containing the list of groups of which the current
user is a member.
.TP
.B BASH
Expands to the full file name used to invoke this instance of
.BR bash .
.TP
.B BASH_VERSION
Expands to a string describing the version of this instance of
.BR bash .
.TP

An array variable whose members hold version information for this
instance of
.BR bash .
The values assigned to the array members are as follows:
.sp .5
.RS
.PD 0
.TP 24
.B BASH_VERSINFO[\fR0\fP]
The major version number (the \fIrelease\fP).
.TP
.B BASH_VERSINFO[\fR1\fP]
The minor version number (the \fIversion\fP).
.TP
.B BASH_VERSINFO[\fR2\fP]
The patch level.
.TP
.B BASH_VERSINFO[\fR3\fP]
The build version.
.TP
.B BASH_VERSINFO[\fR4\fP]
The release status (e.g., \fIbeta1\fP).
.TP
.B BASH_VERSINFO[\fR5\fP]
The value of \fBMACHTYPE\fP.
.PD
.RE
.TP
.B SHLVL
Incremented by one each time an instance of
.B bash
is started.
.TP
.B RANDOM
Each time this parameter is referenced, a random integer between
0 and 32767 is
generated.  The sequence of random numbers may be initialized by assigning
a value to
.SM
.BR RANDOM .
If
.SM
.B RANDOM
is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is
subsequently reset.
.TP
.B SECONDS
Each time this parameter is
referenced, the number of seconds since shell invocation is returned.  If a
value is assigned to 
.SM
.BR SECONDS ,
the value returned upon subsequent
references is
the number of seconds since the assignment plus the value assigned.
If
.SM
.B SECONDS
is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is
subsequently reset.
.TP
.B LINENO
Each time this parameter is referenced, the shell substitutes
a decimal number representing the current sequential line number
(starting with 1) within a script or function.  When not in a
script or function, the value substituted is not guaranteed to
be meaningful.
If
.SM
.B LINENO
is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is
subsequently reset.
.TP
.B HISTCMD
The history number, or index in the history list, of the current
command.
If
.SM
.B HISTCMD
is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is
subsequently reset.
.TP
.B DIRSTACK
An array variable (see
.B Arrays
below) containing the current contents of the directory stack.
Directories appear in the stack in the order they are displayed by the
.B dirs
builtin.
Assigning to members of this array variable may be used to modify
directories already in the stack, but the
.B pushd
and
.B popd
builtins must be used to add and remove directories.
Assignment to this variable will not change the current directory.
If
.SM
.B DIRSTACK
is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is
subsequently reset.
.TP
.B PIPESTATUS
An array variable (see
.B Arrays
below) containing a list of exit status values from the processes
in the most-recently-executed foreground pipeline (which may
contain only a single command).
.TP
.B OPTARG
The value of the last option argument processed by the
.B getopts
builtin command (see
.SM
.B SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
below).
.TP
.B OPTIND
The index of the next argument to be processed by the
.B getopts
builtin command (see
.SM
.B SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
below).
.TP
.B HOSTNAME
Automatically set to the name of the current host.
.TP
.B HOSTTYPE
Automatically set to a string that uniquely
describes the type of machine on which
.B bash
is executing.
The default is system-dependent.
.TP
.B OSTYPE
Automatically set to a string that
describes the operating system on which
.B bash
is executing.
The default is system-dependent.
.TP
.B MACHTYPE
Automatically set to a string that fully describes the system
type on which
.B bash
is executing, in the standard GNU \fIcpu-company-system\fP format.
The default is system-dependent.
.TP
.B SHELLOPTS
A colon-separated list of enabled shell options.  Each word in
the list is a valid argument for the
.B \-o
option to the
.B set
builtin command (see
.SM
.B "SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS"
below).  The options appearing in
.SM
.B SHELLOPTS
are those reported as
.I on
by \fBset \-o\fP.
If this variable is in the environment when
.B bash
starts up, each shell option in the list will be enabled before
reading any startup files.
This variable is read-only.
.PD
.PP
The following variables are used by the shell.  In some cases,
.B bash
assigns a default value to a variable; these cases are noted
below.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.B IFS
The
.I Internal Field Separator
that is used
for word splitting after expansion and to
split lines into words with the
.B read
builtin command.  The default value is
``<space><tab><newline>''.
.TP
.B PATH
The search path for commands.  It
is a colon-separated list of directories in which
the shell looks for commands (see
.SM
.B COMMAND EXECUTION
below).  The default path is system-dependent,
and is set by the administrator who installs
.BR bash .
A common value is ``/usr/gnu/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/ucb:/bin:/usr/bin:.''.
.TP
.B HOME
The home directory of the current user; the default argument for the
\fBcd\fP builtin command.
.TP
.B CDPATH
The search path for the
.B cd
command.  This is a colon-separated
list of directories in which the shell looks for destination directories
specified by the
.B cd
command.  A sample value is
``.:~:/usr''.
.TP
.B BASH_ENV
If this parameter is set when \fBbash\fP is executing a shell script,
its value is interpreted as a filename containing commands to
initialize the shell, as in
.IR .bashrc .
The value of
.SM
.B BASH_ENV
is subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic
expansion before being interpreted as a file name.
.SM
.B PATH
is not used to search for the resultant file name.
.TP
.B MAIL
If this parameter is set to a file name and the
.SM
.B MAILPATH
variable is not set,
.B bash
informs the user of the arrival of mail in the specified file.
.TP
.B MAILCHECK
Specifies how
often (in seconds)
.B bash
checks for mail.  The default is 60 seconds.  When it is time to check
for mail, the shell does so before displaying the primary prompt.
If this variable is unset, the shell disables mail checking.
.TP
.B MAILPATH
A colon-separated list of file names to be checked for mail. 
The message to be printed may be specified by separating the file name from
the message with a `?'.  $_ stands for the name of the current mailfile. 
Example:
.RS
.PP
\fBMAILPATH\fP='/usr/spool/mail/bfox?"You have mail":~/shell\-mail?"$_ has mail!"'
.PP
.B Bash
supplies a default value for this variable, but the location of the user
mail files that it uses is system dependent (e.g., /usr/spool/mail/\fB$USER\fP).
.RE
.TP
.B PS1
The value of this parameter is expanded (see
.SM
.B PROMPTING
below) and used as the primary prompt string.  The default value is
``\fB\es\-\ev\e$ \fP''.
.TP
.B PS2
The value of this parameter is expanded as with
.B PS1
and used as the secondary prompt string.  The default is
``\fB> \fP''.
.TP
.B PS3
The value of this parameter is used as the prompt for the
.B select
command (see
.SM
.B SHELL GRAMMAR
above).
.TP
.B PS4
The value of this parameter is expanded as with
.B PS1
and the value is printed before each command
.B bash
displays during an execution trace.  The first character of
.SM
.B PS4
is replicated multiple times, as necessary, to indicate multiple
levels of indirection.  The default is ``\fB+ \fP''.
.TP
.B TIMEFORMAT
The value of this parameter is used as a format string specifying
how the timing information for pipelines prefixed with the
.B time
reserved word should be displayed.
The \fB%\fP character introduces an escape sequence that is
expanded to a time value or other information.
The escape sequences and their meanings are as follows; the
braces denote optional portions.
.sp .5
.RS
.PD 0
.TP 10
.B %%
A literal \fB%\fP.
.TP
.B %[\fIp\fP][l]R
The elapsed time in seconds.
.TP
.B %[\fIp\fP][l]U
The number of CPU seconds spent in user mode.
.TP
.B %[\fIp\fP][l]S
The number of CPU seconds spent in system mode.
.TP
.B %P
The CPU percentage, computed as (%U + %S) / %R.
.PD
.RE
.IP
The optional \fIp\fP is a digit specifying the \fIprecision\fP,
the number of fractional digits after a decimal point.
A value of 0 causes no decimal point or fraction to be output.
At most three places after the decimal point may be specified;
values of \fIp\fP greater than 3 are changed to 3.
If \fIp\fP is not specified, the value 3 is used.
.IP
The optional \fBl\fP specifies a longer format, including
minutes, of the form \fIMM\fPm\fISS\fP.\fIFF\fPs.
The value of \fIp\fP determines whether or not the fraction is
included.
.IP
If this variable is not set, \fBbash\fP acts as if it had the
value \fB$'\enreal\et%3lR\enuser\et%3lU\ensys\t%3lS'\fP.
If the value is null, no timing information is displayed.
A trailing newline is added when the format string is displayed.
.TP
.B HISTSIZE
The number of commands to remember in the command history (see
.SM
.B HISTORY
below).  The default value is 500.
.TP
.B HISTFILE
The name of the file in which command history is saved (see
.SM
.B HISTORY
below).  The default value is \fI~/.bash_history\fP.  If unset, the
command history is not saved when an interactive shell exits.
.TP
.B HISTFILESIZE
The maximum number of lines contained in the history file.  When this
variable is assigned a value, the history file is truncated, if
necessary, to contain no more than that number of lines.  The default
value is 500.  The history file is also truncated to this size after
writing it when an interactive shell exits.
.TP
.B OPTERR
If set to the value 1,
.B bash
displays error messages generated by the
.B getopts
builtin command (see
.SM
.B SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
below).
.SM
.B OPTERR
is initialized to 1 each time the shell is invoked or a shell
script is executed.
.TP
.B LANG
Used to determine the locale category for any category not specifically
selected with a variable starting with \fBLC_\fP.
.TP
.B LC_ALL
This variable overrides the value of \fBLANG\fP and any other
\fBLC_\fP variable specifying a locale category.
.TP
.B LC_COLLATE
This variable determines the collation order used when sorting the
results of pathname expansion.
.TP
.B LC_MESSAGES
This variable determines the locale used to translate double-quoted
strings preceded by a \fB$\fP.
.TP
.B PROMPT_COMMAND
If set, the value is executed as a command prior to issuing each primary
prompt.
.TP
.B IGNOREEOF
Controls the
action of an interactive shell on receipt of an
.SM
.B EOF
character as the sole input.  If set, the value is the number of
consecutive
.SM
.B EOF
characters which must be
typed as the first characters on an input line before
.B bash
exits.  If the variable exists but does not have a numeric value, or
has no value, the default value is 10.  If it does not exist,
.SM
.B EOF
signifies the end of input to the shell.
.TP
.B TMOUT
If set to a value greater than zero, the value is interpreted as the
number of seconds to wait for input after issuing the primary prompt.
.B Bash
terminates after waiting for that number of seconds if input does
not arrive.
.TP
.B FCEDIT
The default editor for the
.B fc
builtin command.
.TP
.B FIGNORE
A colon-separated list of suffixes to ignore when performing
filename completion (see
.SM
.B READLINE
below).
A filename whose suffix matches one of the entries in 
.SM
.B FIGNORE
is excluded from the list of matched filenames.
A sample value is ``.o:~''.
.TP
.B GLOBIGNORE
A colon-separated list of patterns defining the set of filenames to
be ignored by pathname expansion.
If a filename matched by a pathname expansion pattern also matches one
of the patterns in
.SM
.BR GLOBIGNORE ,
it is removed from the list of matches.
.TP
.B INPUTRC
The filename for the
.B readline
startup file, overriding the default of
.FN ~/.inputrc
(see
.SM
.B READLINE
below).
.TP
.B HISTCONTROL
If set to a value of
.IR ignorespace ,
lines which begin with a
.B space
character are not entered on the history list.  If set to
a value of
.IR ignoredups ,
lines matching the last history line are not entered.
A value of
.I ignoreboth
combines the two options.
If unset, or if set to any other value than those above,
all lines read
by the parser are saved on the history list, subject to the value
of
.BR HISTIGNORE .
This variable's function is superseded by
.BR HISTIGNORE .
.TP
.B HISTIGNORE
A colon-separated list of patterns used to decide which command lines
should be saved on the history list.  Each pattern is anchored at the
beginning of the line and must fully specify the line (no implicit
`\fB*\fP' is appended).  Each pattern is tested against the line
after the checks specified by
.B HISTCONTROL
are applied.
In addition to the normal shell pattern matching characters, `\fB&\fP'
matches the previous history line.  `\fB&\fP' may be escaped using a
backslash.  The backslash is removed before attempting a match.
.TP
.B histchars
The two or three characters which control history expansion
and tokenization (see
.SM
.B HISTORY EXPANSION
below).  The first character is the
.IR "history expansion character" ,
that is, the character which signals the start of a history
expansion, normally `\fB!\fP'.
The second character is the
.IR "quick substitution"
character, which is used as shorthand for re-running the previous
command entered, substituting one string for another in the command.
The default is `\fB^\fP'.
The optional third character is the character
which signifies that the remainder of the line is a comment when found
as the first character of a word, normally `\fB#\fP'.  The history
comment character causes history substitution to be skipped for the
remaining words on the line.  It does not necessarily cause the shell
parser to treat the rest of the line as a comment.
.TP
.B HOSTFILE
Contains the name of a file in the same format as
.FN /etc/hosts
that should be read when the shell needs to complete a
hostname.  The file may be changed interactively; the next
time hostname completion is attempted
.B bash
adds the contents of the new file to the already existing database.
.TP
.B auto_resume
This variable controls how the shell interacts with the user and
job control.  If this variable is set, single word simple
commands without redirections are treated as candidates for resumption
of an existing stopped job.  There is no ambiguity allowed; if there is
more than one job beginning with the string typed, the job most recently
accessed is selected.  The
.I name
of a stopped job, in this context, is the command line used to
start it.
If set to the value
.IR exact ,
the string supplied must match the name of a stopped job exactly;
if set to
.IR substring ,
the string supplied needs to match a substring of the name of a
stopped job.  The
.I substring
value provides functionality analogous to the
.B %?
job identifier (see
.SM
.B JOB CONTROL
below).  If set to any other value, the supplied string must
be a prefix of a stopped job's name; this provides functionality
analogous to the
.B %
job identifier.
.PD
.SS Arrays
.B Bash
provides one-dimensional array variables.  Any variable may be used as
an array; the
.B declare
builtin will explicitly declare an array.  There is no maximum
limit on the size of an array, nor any requirement that members
be indexed or assigned contiguously.  Arrays are indexed using
integers and are zero-based.
.PP
An array is created automatically if any variable is assigned to using
the syntax \fIname\fP[\fIsubscript\fP]=\fIvalue\fP.  The
.I subscript
is treated as an arithmetic expression that must evaluate to a number
greater than or equal to zero.  To explicitly declare an array, use
.B declare \-a \fIname\fP
(see
.SM
.B SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
below).
.B declare \-a \fIname\fP[\fIsubscript\fP]
is also accepted; the \fIsubscript\fP is ignored.  Attributes may be
specified for an array variable using the
.B declare
and
.B readonly
builtins.  Each attribute applies to all members of an array.
.PP
Arrays are assigned to using compound assignments of the form
\fIname\fP=\fB(\fPvalue\fI1\fP ... value\fIn\fP\fB)\fP, where each
\fIvalue\fP is of the form [\fIsubscript\fP]=\fIstring\fP.  Only
\fIstring\fP is required.  If
the optional brackets and subscript are supplied, that index is assigned to;
otherwise the index of the element assigned is the last index assigned
to by the statement plus one.  Indexing starts at zero.
This syntax is also accepted by the
.B declare
builtin.  Individual array elements may be assigned to using the
\fIname\fP[\fIsubscript\fP]=\fIvalue\fP syntax introduced above.
.PP
Any element of an array may be referenced using
${\fIname\fP[\fIsubscript\fP]}.  The braces are required to avoid
conflicts with pathname expansion.  If
\fIsubscript\fP is \fB@\fP or \fB*\fP, the word expands to
all members of \fIname\fP.  These subscripts differ only when the
word appears within double quotes.  If the word is double-quoted,
${\fIname\fP[*]} expands to a single
word with the value of each array member separated by the first
character of the
.SM
.B IFS
special variable, and ${\fIname\fP[@]} expands each element of
\fIname\fP to a separate word.  When there are no array members,
${\fIname\fP[@]} expands to nothing.  This is analogous to the expansion
of the special parameters \fB*\fP and \fB@\fP (see
.B Special Parameters
above).  ${#\fIname\fP[\fIsubscript\fP]} expands to the length of
${\fIname\fP[\fIsubscript\fP]}.  If \fIsubscript\fP is \fB*\fP or
\fB@\fP, the expansion is the number of elements in the array.
Referencing an array variable without a subscript is equivalent to
referencing element zero.
.PP
The
.B unset
builtin is used to destroy arrays.  \fBunset\fP \fIname\fP[\fIsubscript\fP]
destroys the array element at index \fIsubscript\fP.
\fBunset\fP \fIname\fP, where \fIname\fP is an array, or
\fBunset\fP \fIname\fP[\fIsubscript\fP], where
\fIsubscript\fP is \fB*\fP or \fB@\fP, removes the entire array.
.PP
The
.BR declare ,
.BR local ,
and
.B readonly
builtins each accept a
.B \-a
option to specify an array.  The
.B read
builtin accepts a
.B \-a
option to assign a list of words read from the standard input
to an array.  The
.B set
and
.B declare
builtins display array values in a way that allows them to be
reused as assignments.
.SH EXPANSION
Expansion is performed on the command line after it has been split into
words.  There are seven kinds of expansion performed:
.IR "brace expansion" ,
.IR "tilde expansion" ,
.IR "parameter and variable expansion" ,
.IR "command substitution" ,
.IR "arithmetic expansion" ,
.IR "word splitting" ,
and
.IR "pathname expansion" .
.PP
The order of expansions is: brace expansion, tilde expansion,
parameter, variable and arithmetic expansion and
command substitution
(done in a left-to-right fashion), word splitting, and pathname
expansion.
.PP
On systems that can support it, there is an additional expansion
available: \fIprocess substitution\fP.
.PP
Only brace expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion
can change the number of words of the expansion; other expansions
expand a single word to a single word.
The only exceptions to this are the expansions of
``\fB$@\fP'' and ``\fB${\fP\fIname\fP\fB[@]}\fP''
as explained above (see
.SM
.BR PARAMETERS ).
.SS Brace Expansion
.PP
.I "Brace expansion"
is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings
may be generated.  This mechanism is similar to
\fIpathname expansion\fP, but the filenames generated
need not exist.  Patterns to be brace expanded take
the form of an optional
.IR preamble ,
followed by a series of comma-separated strings
between a pair of braces, followed by an optional
.IR postamble .
The preamble is prefixed to each string contained
within the braces, and the postamble is then appended
to each resulting string, expanding left to right.
.PP
Brace expansions may be nested.  The results of each expanded
string are not sorted; left to right order is preserved.
For example, a\fB{\fPd,c,b\fB}\fPe expands into `ade ace abe'.
.PP
Brace expansion is performed before any other expansions,
and any characters special to other expansions are preserved
in the result.  It is strictly textual.
.B Bash
does not apply any syntactic interpretation to the context of the
expansion or the text between the braces.
.PP
A correctly-formed brace expansion must contain unquoted opening
and closing braces, and at least one unquoted comma.
Any incorrectly formed brace expansion is left unchanged.
A \fB{\fP or \fB,\fP may be quoted with a backslash to prevent its
being considered part of a brace expression.
.PP
This construct is typically used as shorthand when the common
prefix of the strings to be generated is longer than in the
above example:
.RS
.PP
mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}
.RE
or
.RS
chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}
.RE
.PP
Brace expansion introduces a slight incompatibility with
historical versions of
.BR sh .
.B sh
does not treat opening or closing braces specially when they
appear as part of a word, and preserves them in the output.
.B Bash
removes braces from words as a consequence of brace
expansion.  For example, a word entered to
.B sh
as \fIfile{1,2}\fP
appears identically in the output.  The same word is
output as
.I file1 file2
after expansion by
.BR bash .
If strict compatibility with
.B sh
is desired, start
.B bash
with the
.B +B 
option or disable brace expansion with the
.B +B
option to the
.B set
command (see
.SM
.B SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
below).
.SS Tilde Expansion
.PP
If a word begins with a tilde character (`\fB~\fP'), all of the characters
preceding the first slash (or all characters, if there is no slash)
are treated as a possible \fIlogin name\fP. If this \fIlogin name\fP
is the null string, the tilde is replaced with the value of the
parameter
.SM
.BR HOME .
If
.SM
.B HOME
is unset, the home directory of
the user executing the shell is substituted instead.
.PP
If a `+' follows the tilde, the value of
.SM
.B PWD
replaces the tilde and `+'.  If
a `\-' follows, the value of
.SM
.B OLDPWD
is substituted.
If the value following the tilde is a valid \fIlogin name\fP,
the tilde and \fIlogin name\fP are replaced with the home directory
associated with that name.  If the name is invalid, or the tilde
expansion fails, the word is unchanged.
.PP
Each variable assignment is checked for unquoted
tildes immediately following a
.B :
or
.BR = .
In these cases, tilde substitution is also performed.  Consequently, one
may use file names with tildes in assignments to
.SM
.BR PATH ,
.SM
.BR MAILPATH ,
and
.SM
.BR CDPATH ,
and the shell assigns the expanded value.
.SS Parameter Expansion
.PP
The `\fB$\fP' character introduces parameter expansion,
command substitution, or arithmetic expansion.  The parameter name
or symbol to be expanded may be enclosed in braces, which
are optional but serve to protect the variable to be expanded from
characters immediately following it which could be
interpreted as part of the name.

.PD
.PP
If the first character of \fIparameter\fP is an exclamation point,
a level of variable indirection is introduced.
\fBBash\fP uses the value of the variable formed from the rest of
\fIparameter\fP as the name of the variable; this variable is then
expanded and that value used in the rest of the substitution, rather
than the value of \fIparameter\fP itself.
This is known as \fIindirect expansion\fP.
.PP
In each of the cases below, \fIword\fP is subject to tilde expansion,
parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.
When not performing substring expansion, \fBbash\fP tests for a parameter
that is unset or null; omitting the colon results in a test only for a
parameter that is unset.

\fBSubstring Expansion.\fP

starting at \fIoffset\fP.
If \fIlength\fP is omitted, expands to the substring of
\fIparameter\fP, starting at the character specified by \fIoffset\fP.
\fIlength\fP and \fIoffset\fP are arithmetic expressions (see
.SM
.B
ARITHMETIC EVALUATION
below).
\fIlength\fP must evaluate to a number greater than or equal to zero.
If \fIoffset\fP evaluates to a number less than zero, the value
is used as an offset from the end of the value of \fIparameter\fP.
If \fIparameter\fP is \fB@\fP, the result is \fIlength\fP positional
parameters beginning at \fIoffset\fP.
If \fIparameter\fP is an array name indexed by @ or *,
the result is the \fIlength\fP

.SS Command Substitution
.PP
\fICommand substitution\fP allows the output of a command to replace 
the command name.  There are two forms:
.PP
.RS
.PP
\fB$(\fP\fIcommand\fP\|\fB)\fP
.RE
or
.RS
\fB`\fP\fIcommand\fP\fB`\fP
.RE
.PP
.B Bash
performs the expansion by executing \fIcommand\fP and
replacing the command substitution with the standard output of the
command, with any trailing newlines deleted.
.PP
When the old-style backquote form of substitution is used,
backslash retains its literal meaning except when followed by
.BR $ ,
.BR ` ,
or
.BR \e .
When using the $(\^\fIcommand\fP\|) form, all characters between the
parentheses make up the command; none are treated specially.
.PP
Command substitutions may be nested.  To nest when using the old form,
escape the inner backquotes with backslashes.
.PP
If the substitution appears within double quotes, word splitting and
pathname expansion are not performed on the results.
.SS Arithmetic Expansion
.PP
Arithmetic expansion allows the evaluation of an arithmetic expression
and the substitution of the result.  The format for arithmetic expansion is:
.RS
.PP
\fB$((\fP\fIexpression\fP\fB))\fP
.RE
.PP
The
.I expression
is treated as if it were within double quotes, but a double quote
inside the parentheses is not treated specially.
All tokens in the expression undergo parameter expansion, string
expansion, command substitution, and quote removal.
Arithmetic substitutions may be nested.
.PP
The evaluation is performed according to the rules listed below under
.SM
.BR "ARITHMETIC EVALUATION" .
If
.I expression
is invalid,
.B bash
prints a message indicating failure and no substitution occurs.
.SS Process Substitution
.PP
\fIProcess substitution\fP is supported on systems that support named
pipes (\fIFIFOs\fP) or the \fB/dev/fd\fP method of naming open files.
It takes the form of
\fB<(\fP\fIlist\^\fP\fB)\fP
or
\fB>(\fP\fIlist\^\fP\fB)\fP.
The process \fIlist\fP is run with its input or output connected to a
\fIFIFO\fP or some file in \fB/dev/fd\fP.  The name of this file is
passed as an argument to the current command as the result of the
expansion.  If the \fB>(\fP\fIlist\^\fP\fB)\fP form is used, writing to
the file will provide input for \fIlist\fP.  If the
\fB<(\fP\fIlist\^\fP\fB)\fP form is used, the file passed as an
argument should be read to obtain the output of \fIlist\fP.
.PP
On systems that support it, \fIprocess substitution\fP is performed
simultaneously with parameter and variable expansion, 
command substitution,
and arithmetic expansion.
.SS Word Splitting
.PP
The shell scans the results of
parameter expansion,
command substitution,
and
arithmetic expansion
that did not occur within double quotes for
.IR "word splitting" .
.PP
The shell treats each character of
.SM
.B IFS
as a delimiter, and splits the results of the other
expansions into words on these characters.  If
.SM
.B IFS
is unset, or its
value is exactly
.BR <space><tab><newline> ,
the default, then
any sequence of
.SM
.B IFS
characters serves to delimit words.  If
.SM
.B IFS
has a value other than the default, then sequences of
the whitespace characters
.B space
and
.B tab
are ignored at the beginning and end of the
word, as long as the whitespace character is in the
value of
.SM
.BR IFS
(an
.SM
.B IFS
whitespace character).
Any character in
.SM
.B IFS
that is not
.SM
.B IFS
whitespace, along with any adjacent
.SM
.B IFS
whitespace characters, delimits a field.
A sequence of
.SM
.B IFS
whitespace characters is also treated as a delimiter.
If the value of
.SM
.B IFS
is null, no word splitting occurs.
.PP
Explicit null arguments (\^\f3"\^"\fP or \^\f3'\^'\fP\^) are retained.
Unquoted implicit null arguments, resulting from the expansion of
.I parameters
that have no values, are removed.
If a parameter with no value is expanded within double quotes, a
null argument results and is retained.
.PP
Note that if no expansion occurs, no splitting
is performed.
.SS Pathname Expansion
.PP
After word splitting,
unless the
.B \-f
option has been set,
.B bash
scans each word for the characters
.BR * ,
.BR ? ,
and
.BR [ .
If one of these characters appears, then the word is
regarded as a
.IR pattern ,
and replaced with an alphabetically sorted list of
file names matching the pattern.
If no matching file names are found,
and the shell option
.B nullglob
is disabled, the word is left unchanged.
If the option is set, and no matches are found,
the word is removed.
When a pattern is used for pathname expansion,
the character
.B ``.''
at the start of a name or immediately following a slash
must be matched explicitly, unless the shell option
.B dotglob
is set.
The slash character must always be matched explicitly.
In other cases, the
.B ``.''
character is not treated specially.
See the description of
.B shopt
below under
.SM
.B SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
for a description of the
.B nullglob
and
.B dotglob
shell options.
.PP
The
.SM
.B GLOBIGNORE
shell variable may be used to restrict the set of file names matching a
.IR pattern .
If
.SM
.B GLOBIGNORE
is set, each matching file name that also matches one of the patterns in
.SM
.B GLOBIGNORE
is removed from the list of matches.
The file names
.B ``.''
and
.B ``..''
are always ignored, even when
.SM
.B GLOBIGNORE
is set.  However, setting
.SM
.B GLOBIGNORE
has the effect of enabling the
.B dotglob
shell option, so all other file names beginning with a
.B ``.''
will match.
To get the old behavior of ignoring file names beginning with a
.BR ``.'' ,
make
.B ``.*''
one of the patterns in
.SM
.BR GLOBIGNORE .
The
.B dotglob
option is disabled when
.SM
.B GLOBIGNORE
is unset.
.PP
The special pattern characters have the following meanings:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.B *
Matches any string, including the null string.
.TP
.B ?
Matches any single character.
.TP
.B [...]
Matches any one of the enclosed characters.  A pair of characters
separated by a minus sign denotes a
.IR range ;
any character lexically between those two characters, inclusive,
is matched.  If the first character following the
.B [
is a
.B !
or a
.B ^
then any character not enclosed is matched.
A 
.B \-
may be matched by including it as the first or last character
in the set.
A
.B ]
may be matched by including it as the first character
in the set.
.PD
.SS Quote Removal
.PP
After the preceding expansions, all unquoted occurrences of the
characters
.BR \e ,
.BR ` ,
and \^\f3"\fP\^ that did not result from one of the above
expansions are removed.
.SH REDIRECTION
Before a command is executed, its input and output
may be
.I redirected
using a special notation interpreted by the shell.
Redirection may also be used to open and close files for the
current shell execution environment.  The following redirection
operators may precede or appear anywhere within a
.I simple command
or may follow a
.IR command .
Redirections are processed in the order they appear, from
left to right.
.PP
In the following descriptions, if the file descriptor number is
omitted, and the first character of the redirection operator is
.BR < ,
the redirection refers to the standard input (file descriptor
0).  If the first character of the redirection operator is
.BR > ,
the redirection refers to the standard output (file descriptor
1).
.PP
The word that follows the redirection operator in the following
descriptions is subjected to brace expansion, tilde expansion,
parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion,
quote removal, and pathname expansion.  If it expands to more
than one word,
.B bash
reports an error.
.PP
Note that the order of redirections is significant.  For example, 
the command
.RS
.PP
ls \fB>\fP dirlist 2\fB>&\fP1
.RE
.PP
directs both standard output and standard error to the file 
.IR dirlist ,
while the command
.RS
.PP
ls 2\fB>&\fP1 \fB>\fP dirlist
.RE
.PP
directs only the standard output to file
.IR dirlist ,
because the standard error was duplicated as standard output
before the standard output was redirected to
.IR dirlist .
.SS Redirecting Input
.PP
Redirection of input causes the file whose name results from
the expansion of
.I word
to be opened for reading on file descriptor
.IR n ,
or the standard input (file descriptor 0) if
.I n
is not specified.
.PP
The general format for redirecting input is:
.RS
.PP
[\fIn\fP]\fB<\fP\fIword\fP
.RE
.SS Redirecting Output
.PP
Redirection of output causes the file whose name results from
the expansion of
.I word
to be opened for writing on file descriptor
.IR n ,
or the standard output (file descriptor 1) if
.I n
is not specified.  If the file does not exist it is created;
if it does exist it is truncated to zero size.
.PP
The general format for redirecting output is:
.RS
.PP
[\fIn\fP]\fB>\fP\fIword\fP
.RE
.PP
If the redirection operator is
.BR > ,
and the
.B \-C
option to the
.B set
builtin has been enabled, the redirection will fail if the filename
whose name results from the expansion of \fIword\fP exists.
If the redirection operator is
.BR >| ,
then the value of the
.B \-C
option to the
.B set
builtin command is not tested, and the redirection is attempted even
if the file named by \fIword\fP exists.
.SS Appending Redirected Output
.PP
Redirection of output in this fashion
causes the file whose name results from
the expansion of
.I word
to be opened for appending on file descriptor
.IR n ,
or the standard output (file descriptor 1) if
.I n
is not specified.  If the file does not exist it is created.
.PP
The general format for appending output is:
.RS
.PP
[\fIn\fP]\fB>>\fP\fIword\fP
.RE
.PP
.SS Redirecting Standard Output and Standard Error
.PP
.B Bash
allows both the
standard output (file descriptor 1) and
the standard error output (file descriptor 2)
to be redirected to the file whose name is the
expansion of
.I word
with this construct.
.PP
There are two formats for redirecting standard output and
standard error:
.RS
.PP
\fB&>\fP\fIword\fP
.RE
and
.RS
\fB>&\fP\fIword\fP
.RE
.PP
Of the two forms, the first is preferred.
This is semantically equivalent to
.RS
.PP
\fB>\fP\fIword\fP 2\fB>&\fP1
.RE
.SS Here Documents
.PP
This type of redirection instructs the shell to read input from the
current source until a line containing only
.I word
(with no trailing blanks)
is seen.  All of
the lines read up to that point are then used as the standard
input for a command.
.PP
The format of here-documents is as follows:
.RS
.PP
.nf
\fB<<\fP[\fB\-\fP]\fIword\fP
        \fIhere\-document\fP
\fIdelimiter\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
No parameter expansion, command substitution, pathname
expansion, or arithmetic expansion is performed on
.IR word .
If any characters in
.I word
are quoted, the
.I delimiter
is the result of quote removal on
.IR word ,
and the lines in the here-document are not expanded.  Otherwise,
all lines of the here-document are subjected to parameter expansion,
command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.  In the latter
case, the pair
.B \e<newline>
is ignored, and
.B \e
must be used to quote the characters
.BR \e ,
.BR $ ,
and
.BR ` .
.PP
If the redirection operator is
.BR <<\- ,
then all leading tab characters are stripped from input lines and the
line containing
.IR delimiter .
This allows
here-documents within shell scripts to be indented in a
natural fashion.
.SS "Duplicating File Descriptors"
.PP
The redirection operator
.RS
.PP
[\fIn\fP]\fB<&\fP\fIword\fP
.RE
.PP
is used to duplicate input file descriptors.
If
.I word
expands to one or more digits, the file descriptor denoted by
.I n
is made to be a copy of that file descriptor.  If
.I word
evaluates to
.BR \- ,
file descriptor
.I n
is closed.  If
.I n
is not specified, the standard input (file descriptor 0) is used.
.PP
The operator
.RS
.PP
[\fIn\fP]\fB>&\fP\fIword\fP
.RE
.PP
is used similarly to duplicate output file descriptors.  If
.I n
is not specified, the standard output (file descriptor 1) is used.
As a special case, if \fIn\fP is omitted, and \fIword\fP does not
expand to one or more digits, the standard output and standard
error are redirected as described previously.
.SS "Opening File Descriptors for Reading and Writing"
.PP
The redirection operator
.RS
.PP
[\fIn\fP]\fB<>\fP\fIword\fP
.RE
.PP
causes the file whose name is the expansion of
.I word
to be opened for both reading and writing on file descriptor
.IR n ,
or on file descriptor 0 if
.I n
is not specified.  If the file does not exist, it is created.
.SH ALIASES
The shell maintains a list of
.I aliases
that may be set and unset with the
.B alias
and
.B unalias
builtin commands (see
.SM
.B SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
below).
The first word of each command, if unquoted,
is checked to see if it has an
alias.  If so, that word is replaced by the text of the alias.
The alias name and the replacement text may contain any valid
shell input, including the
.I metacharacters
listed above, with the exception that the alias name may not
contain \fI=\fP.  The first word of the replacement text is tested
for aliases, but a word that is identical to an alias being expanded
is not expanded a second time.  This means that one may alias
.B ls
to
.BR "ls \-F" ,
for instance, and
.B bash
does not try to recursively expand the replacement text.
If the last character of the alias value is a
.IR blank ,
then the next command
word following the alias is also checked for alias expansion.
.PP
Aliases are created and listed with the
.B alias
command, and removed with the
.B unalias
command.
.PP
There is no mechanism for using arguments in the replacement text.
If arguments are needed, a shell function should be used.
.PP
Aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless
the
.B expand_aliases
shell option is set using
.B shopt
(see the description of
.B shopt
under
.SM
\fBSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\fP
below).
.PP
The rules concerning the definition and use of aliases are
somewhat confusing.
.B Bash
always reads at least one complete line
of input before executing any
of the commands on that line.  Aliases are expanded when a
command is read, not when it is executed.  Therefore, an
alias definition appearing on the same line as another
command does not take effect until the next line of input is read.
The commands following the alias definition
on that line are not affected by the new alias.
This behavior is also an issue when functions are executed.
Aliases are expanded when the function definition is read,
not when the function is executed, because a function definition
is itself a compound command.  As a consequence, aliases
defined in a function are not available until after that
function is executed.  To be safe, always put
alias definitions on a separate line, and do not use
.B alias
in compound commands.
.PP
Note that for almost every purpose, aliases are superseded by
shell functions.
.SH FUNCTIONS
A shell function, defined as described above under
.SM
.BR "SHELL GRAMMAR" ,
stores a series of commands for later execution.
Functions are executed in the context of the
current shell; no new process is created to interpret
them (contrast this with the execution of a shell script).
When a function is executed, the arguments to the
function become the positional parameters
during its execution.  The special parameter
.B #
is updated to reflect the change.  Positional parameter 0
is unchanged.  All other aspects of the shell execution
environment are identical between a function and its caller
with the exception that the
.SM
.B DEBUG
trap (see the description of the
.B trap
builtin under
.SM
.B SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
below) is not inherited.
.PP
Variables local to the function may be declared with the
.B local
builtin command.  Ordinarily, variables and their values
are shared between the function and its caller.
.PP
If the builtin command
.B return
is executed in a function, the function completes and
execution resumes with the next command after the function
call.  When a function completes, the values of the
positional parameters and the special parameter
.B #
are restored to the values they had prior to function
execution.
.PP
Function names and definitions may be listed with the
.B \-f
option to the
.B declare
or
.B typeset
builtin commands.  The
.B \-F
option to
.B declare
or
.B typeset
will list the function names only.
Functions may be exported so that subshells
automatically have them defined with the
.B \-f
option to the 
.B export
builtin.
.PP
Functions may be recursive.  No limit is imposed on the number
of recursive calls.
.SH "COMMAND EXECUTION"
After a command has been split into words, if it results in a
simple command and an optional list of arguments, the following
actions are taken.
.PP
If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to
locate it.  If there exists a shell function by that name, that
function is invoked as described above in
.SM
.BR FUNCTIONS .
If the name does not match a function, the shell searches for
it in the list of shell builtins.  If a match is found, that
builtin is invoked.
.PP
If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin,
and contains no slashes,
.B bash
searches each element of the
.SM
.B PATH
for a directory containing an executable file by that name.
.B Bash
uses a hash table to remember the full file names of executable
files (see
.B hash
under
.SM
.B "SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS"
below).
A full search of the directories in
.SM
.B PATH
is performed only if the command is not found in the hash table.
If the search is unsuccessful, the shell prints an error
message and returns a non-zero exit status.
.PP
If the search is successful, or if the command name contains
one or more slashes, the shell executes the named program.
Argument 0 is set to the name given, and the remaining arguments
to the command are set to the arguments given, if any.
.PP
If this execution fails because the file is not in executable
format, and the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be
a \fIshell script\fP, a file
containing shell commands.  A subshell is spawned to execute
it.  This subshell reinitializes itself, so
that the effect is as if a new shell had been invoked
to handle the script, with the exception that the locations of
commands remembered by the parent (see
.B hash
below under
.SM
\fBSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\fP)
are retained by the child.
.PP
If the program is a file beginning with
.BR #! ,
the remainder of the first line specifies an interpreter
for the program.  The shell executes the
specified interpreter on operating systems that do not
handle this executable format themselves.  The arguments to the 
interpreter consist of a single optional argument following the
interpreter name on the first line of the program, followed
by the name of the program, followed by the command
arguments, if any.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings
called the
.IR environment .
This is a list of 
\fIname\fP\-\fIvalue\fP pairs, of the form
.IR "name\fR=\fPvalue" .
.PP
The shell allows you to manipulate the environment in several
ways.  On invocation, the shell scans its own environment and
creates a parameter for each name found, automatically marking
it for
.I export
to child processes.  Executed commands inherit the environment.
The
.B export
and
.B declare \-x
commands allow parameters and functions to be added to and
deleted from the environment.  If the value of a parameter
in the environment is modified, the new value becomes part
of the environment, replacing the old.  The environment
inherited by any executed command consists of the shell's
initial environment, whose values may be modified in the shell,
less any pairs removed by the
.B unset
command, plus any additions via the
.B export
and
.B declare \-x
commands.
.PP
The environment for any
.I simple command
or function may be augmented temporarily by prefixing it with
parameter assignments, as described above in
.SM
.BR PARAMETERS .
These assignment statements affect only the environment seen
by that command.
.PP
If the 
.B \-k
flag is set (see the
.B set
builtin command below), then
.I all
parameter assignments are placed in the environment for a command,
not just those that precede the command name.
.PP
When
.B bash
invokes an external command, the variable
.B _
is set to the full file name of the command and passed to that
command in its environment.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
For the purposes of the shell, a command which exits with a 
zero exit status has succeeded.  An exit status of zero
indicates success.  A non-zero exit status indicates failure.
When a command terminates on a fatal signal, \fBbash\fP uses
the value of 128+\fBsignal\fP as the exit status.
.PP
If a command is not found, the child process created to
execute it returns a status of 127.  If a command is found
but is not executable, the return status is 126.
.PP
Shell builtin commands return a status of 0 (\fItrue\fP) if
successful, and non-zero (\fIfalse\fP) if an error occurs
while they execute. 
All builtins return an exit status of 2 to indicate incorrect usage.
.PP
\fBBash\fP itself returns the exit status of the last command
executed, unless a syntax error occurs, in which case it exits
with a non-zero value.  See also the \fBexit\fP builtin
command below.
.SH SIGNALS
When \fBbash\fP is interactive, it ignores
.SM
.B SIGTERM
(so that \fBkill 0\fP does not kill an interactive shell),
and
.SM
.B SIGINT
is caught and handled (so that the \fBwait\fP builtin is interruptible).
In all cases, \fBbash\fP ignores
.SM
.BR SIGQUIT .
If job control is in effect,
.B bash
ignores
.SM
.BR SIGTTIN ,
.SM
.BR SIGTTOU ,
and
.SM
.BR SIGTSTP .
.PP
Synchronous jobs started by \fBbash\fP have signals set to the
values inherited by the shell from its parent.  When job control
is not in effect, background jobs (jobs started with
.BR & )
ignore
.SM
.B SIGINT
and
.SM
.BR SIGQUIT .
Commands run as a result of command substitution ignore the
keyboard-generated job control signals
.SM
.BR SIGTTIN ,
.SM
.BR SIGTTOU ,
and
.SM
.BR SIGTSTP .
.PP
The shell exits by default upon receipt of a
.SM
.BR SIGHUP .
Before exiting, it resends the
.SM
.B SIGHUP
to all jobs, running or stopped.  To prevent the shell from
sending the signal to a particular job, remove it from the
jobs table with the 
.B disown
builtin (see
.SM
.B "SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS"
below) or use
.B "disown \-h"
to mark it to not receive
.SM
.BR SIGHUP .
.SH "JOB CONTROL"
.I Job control
refers to the ability to selectively stop (\fIsuspend\fP)
the execution of processes and continue (\fIresume\fP)
their execution at a later point.  A user typically employs
this facility via an interactive interface supplied jointly
by the system's terminal driver and
.BR bash .
.PP
The shell associates a
.I job
with each pipeline.  It keeps a table of currently executing
jobs, which may be listed with the
.B jobs
command.  When
.B bash
starts a job asynchronously (in the
.IR background ),
it prints a line that looks like:
.RS
.PP
[1] 25647
.RE
.PP
indicating that this job is job number 1 and that the process ID
of the last process in the pipeline associated with this job is 25647.
All of the processes in a single pipeline are members of the same job.
.B Bash
uses the
.I job
abstraction as the basis for job control.
.PP
To facilitate the implementation of the user interface to job
control, the system maintains the notion of a \fIcurrent terminal
process group ID\fP.  Members of this process group (processes whose
process group ID is equal to the current terminal process group ID)
receive keyboard-generated signals such as
.SM
.BR SIGINT .
These processes are said to be in the
.IR foreground .
.I Background
processes are those whose process group ID differs from the terminal's;
such processes are immune to keyboard-generated signals.
Only foreground processes are allowed to read from or write to the
terminal.  Background processes which attempt to read from (write to) the
terminal are sent a 
.SM
.B SIGTTIN (SIGTTOU)
signal by the terminal driver, 
which, unless caught, suspends the process.
.PP
If the operating system on which
.B bash
is running supports
job control,
.B bash
allows you to use it.
Typing the
.I suspend
character (typically
.BR ^Z ,
Control-Z) while a process is running
causes that process to be stopped and returns you to 
.BR bash .
Typing the
.I "delayed suspend"
character (typically
.BR ^Y ,
Control-Y) causes the process to be stopped when it
attempts to read input from the terminal, and control to
be returned to
.BR bash .
You may then manipulate the state of this job, using the
.B bg
command to continue it in the background, the
.B fg
command to continue it in the foreground, or
the
.B kill
command to kill it.  A \fB^Z\fP takes effect immediately,
and has the additional side effect of causing pending output
and typeahead to be discarded.
.PP
There are a number of ways to refer to a job in the shell.
The character
.B %
introduces a job name.  Job number
.I n
may be referred to as
.BR %n .
A job may also be referred to using a prefix of the name used to
start it, or using a substring that appears in its command line.
For example,
.B %ce
refers to a stopped
.B ce
job.  If a prefix matches more than one job,
.B bash
reports an error.  Using
.BR %?ce ,
on the other hand, refers to any job containing the string
.B ce
in its command line.  If the substring matches more than one job,
.B bash
reports an error.  The symbols
.B %%
and
.B %+
refer to the shell's notion of the
.IR "current job" ,
which is the last job stopped while it was in
the foreground.
The 
.I "previous job"
may be referenced using
.BR %\- .
In output pertaining to jobs (e.g., the output of the
.B jobs
command), the current job is always flagged with a
.BR + ,
and the previous job with a
.BR \- .
.PP
Simply naming a job can be used to bring it into the
foreground:
.B %1
is a synonym for
\fB``fg %1''\fP,
bringing job 1 from the background into the foreground.
Similarly,
.B ``%1 &''
resumes job 1 in the background, equivalent to
\fB``bg %1''\fP.
.PP
The shell learns immediately whenever a job changes state.
Normally,
.B bash
waits until it is about to print a prompt before reporting
changes in a job's status so as to not interrupt
any other output.  If the 
.B \-b
option to the
.B set
builtin command
is set,
.B bash
reports such changes immediately.
.PP
If an attempt to exit
.B bash
is made while jobs are stopped, the shell prints a warning message.  The
.B jobs
command may then be used to inspect their status.
If a second attempt to exit is made without an intervening command,
the shell does not print another warning, and the stopped
jobs are terminated.
.SH PROMPTING
When executing interactively, 
.B bash
displays the primary prompt
.SM
.B PS1
when it is ready to read a command, and the secondary prompt
.SM
.B PS2
when it needs more input to complete a command.
.B Bash
allows these prompt strings to be customized by inserting a number of
backslash-escaped special characters that are decoded as follows:
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B \ea
an ASCII bell character (07)
.TP
.B \ed
the date in "Weekday Month Date" format (e.g., "Tue May 26")
.TP
.B \ee
an ASCII escape character (033)
.TP
.B \eh
the hostname up to the first `.'
.TP
.B \eH
the hostname
.TP
.B \en
newline
.TP
.B \es
the name of the shell, the basename of
.B $0
(the portion following the final slash)
.TP
.B \et
the current time in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format
.TP
.B \eT
the current time in 12-hour HH:MM:SS format
.TP
.B \e@
the current time in 12-hour am/pm format
.TP
.B \eu
the username of the current user
.TP
.B \ev
the version of \fBbash\fP (e.g., 2.00)
.TP
.B \eV
the release of \fBbash\fP, version + patchlevel (e.g., 2.00.0)
.TP
.B \ew
the current working directory
.TP
.B \eW
the basename of the current working directory
.TP
.B \e!
the history number of this command
.TP
.B \e#
the command number of this command
.TP
.B \e$
if the effective UID is 0, a
.BR # ,
otherwise a
.B $
.TP
.B \e\fInnn\fP
the character corresponding to the octal number \fInnn\fP
.TP
.B \e\e
a backslash
.TP
.B \e[
begin a sequence of non-printing characters, which could be used to
embed a terminal control sequence into the prompt
.TP
.B \e]
end a sequence of non-printing characters
.PD
.RE
.PP
The command number and the history number are usually different:
the history number of a command is its position in the history
list, which may include commands restored from the history file
(see
.SM
.B HISTORY
below), while the command number is the position in the sequence
of commands executed during the current shell session.
After the string is decoded, it is expanded via
parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion,
string expansion, and quote removal, subject to the value of the
.B promptvars
shell option (see the description of the
.B shopt
command under
.SM
.B "SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS"
below).
.SH READLINE
This is the library that handles reading input when using an interactive
shell, unless the
.B \-\-noediting
option is given at shell invocation.
By default, the line editing commands are similar to those of emacs.
A vi-style line editing interface is also available.
To turn off line editing after the shell is running, use the
.B +o emacs
or
.B +o vi
options to the
.B set
builtin (see
.SM
.B SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
below).
.SS "Readline Notation"
.PP
In this section, the emacs-style notation is used to denote
keystrokes.  Control keys are denoted by C\-\fIkey\fR, e.g., C\-n
means Control\-N.  Similarly, 
.I meta
keys are denoted by M\-\fIkey\fR, so M\-x means Meta\-X.  (On keyboards
without a 
.I meta
key, M\-\fIx\fP means ESC \fIx\fP, i.e., press the Escape key
then the
.I x
key.  This makes ESC the \fImeta prefix\fP.
The combination M\-C\-\fIx\fP means ESC\-Control\-\fIx\fP,
or press the Escape key
then hold the Control key while pressing the
.I x
key.)
.PP
Readline commands may be given numeric
.IR arguments ,
which normally act as a repeat count.
Sometimes, however, it is the sign of the argument that is significant.
Passing a negative argument to a command that acts in the forward
direction (e.g., \fBkill\-line\fP) causes that command to act in a
backward direction. 
Commands whose behavior with arguments deviates from this are noted
below.
.PP
When a command is described as \fIkilling\fP text, the text
deleted is saved for possible future retrieval
(\fIyanking\fP).  The killed text is saved in a
\fIkill ring\fP.  Consecutive kills cause the text to be
accumulated into one unit, which can be yanked all at once. 
Commands which do not kill text separate the chunks of text
on the kill ring.
.SS "Readline Initialization"
.PP
Readline is customized by putting commands in an initialization
file (the \fIinputrc\fP file).
The name of this file is taken from the value of the
.SM
.B INPUTRC
variable.  If that variable is unset, the default is
.IR ~/.inputrc .
When a program which uses the readline library starts up, the
initialization file is read, and the key bindings and variables
are set.
There are only a few basic constructs allowed in the
readline initialization file.
Blank lines are ignored.
Lines beginning with a \fB#\fP are comments.
Lines beginning with a \fB$\fP indicate conditional constructs.
Other lines denote key bindings and variable settings.
.PP
The default key-bindings may be changed with an
.I inputrc 
file.
Other programs that use this library may add their own commands
and bindings.
.PP
For example, placing
.RS
.PP
M\-Control\-u: universal\-argument
.RE
or
.RS
C\-Meta\-u: universal\-argument
.RE
into the 
.I inputrc
would make M\-C\-u execute the readline command
.IR universal\-argument .
.PP
The following symbolic character names are recognized:
.IR RUBOUT ,
.IR DEL ,
.IR ESC ,
.IR LFD ,
.IR NEWLINE ,
.IR RET ,
.IR RETURN ,
.IR SPC ,
.IR SPACE ,
and
.IR TAB .
In addition to command names, readline allows keys to be bound
to a string that is inserted when the key is pressed (a \fImacro\fP).
.SS "Readline Key Bindings"
.PP
The syntax for controlling key bindings in the
.I ~/.inputrc
file is simple.  All that is required is the name of the
command or the text of a macro and a key sequence to which
it should be bound. The name may be specified in one of two ways:
as a symbolic key name, possibly with \fIMeta\-\fP or \fIControl\-\fP
prefixes, or as a key sequence.
When using the form \fBkeyname\fP:\fIfunction\-name\fP or \fImacro\fP,
.I keyname
is the name of a key spelled out in English.  For example:
.sp
.RS
Control-u: universal\-argument
.br
Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word
.br
Control-o: "> output"
.RE
.LP
In the above example,
.I C\-u
is bound to the function
.BR universal\-argument ,
.I M\-DEL
is bound to the function
.BR backward\-kill\-word ,
and
.I C\-o
is bound to run the macro
expressed on the right hand side (that is, to insert the text
.I "> output"
into the line).
.PP
In the second form, \fB"keyseq"\fP:\fIfunction\-name\fP or \fImacro\fP,
.B keyseq
differs from
.B keyname
above in that strings denoting
an entire key sequence may be specified by placing the sequence
within double quotes.  Some GNU Emacs style key escapes can be
used, as in the following example.
.sp
.RS
"\eC\-u": universal\-argument
.br
"\eC\-x\eC\-r": re\-read\-init\-file
.br
"\ee[11~": "Function Key 1"
.RE
.PP
In this example,
.I C\-u
is again bound to the function
.BR universal\-argument .
.I "C\-x C\-r"
is bound to the function
.BR re\-read\-init\-file ,
and 
.I "ESC [ 1 1 ~"
is bound to insert the text
.BR "Function Key 1" .
The full set of escape sequences is
.RS
.TP
.B \eC\-
control prefix
.TP
.B \eM\-
meta prefix
.TP
.B \ee
an escape character
.TP
.B \e\e
backslash
.TP
.B \e"
literal "
.TP
.B \e'
literal '
.RE
.PP
When entering the text of a macro, single or double quotes should
be used to indicate a macro definition.  Unquoted text
is assumed to be a function name.  Backslash
will quote any character in the macro text, including " and '.
.PP
.B Bash
allows the current readline key bindings to be displayed or modified
with the
.B bind
builtin command.  The editing mode may be switched during interactive
use by using the
.B \-o
option to the
.B set
builtin command (see
.SM
.B SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
below).
.SS "Readline Variables"
.PP
Readline has variables that can be used to further customize its
behavior.  A variable may be set in the
.I inputrc
file with a statement of the form
.RS
.PP
\fBset\fP \fIvariable\-name\fP \fIvalue\fP
.RE
.PP
Except where noted, readline variables can take the values
.B On
or
.BR Off .
The variables and their default values are:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.B bell\-style (audible)
Controls what happens when readline wants to ring the terminal bell.
If set to \fBnone\fP, readline never rings the bell.  If set to
\fBvisible\fP, readline uses a visible bell if one is available.
If set to \fBaudible\fP, readline attempts to ring the terminal's bell.
.TP
.B comment\-begin (``#'')
The string that is inserted when the
.B readline
.B insert\-comment
command is executed.
This command is bound to
.B M\-#
in emacs mode and to
.B #
in vi command mode.
.TP
.B completion\-query\-items (100)
This determines when the user is queried about viewing
the number of possible completions
generated by the \fBpossible\-completions\fP command.
It may be set to any integer value greater than or equal to
zero.  If the number of possible completions is greater than
or equal to the value of this variable, the user is asked whether
or not he wishes to view them; otherwise they are simply listed
on the terminal.
.TP
.B convert\-meta (On)
If set to \fBOn\fP, readline will convert characters with the
eighth bit set to an ASCII key sequence
by stripping the eighth bit and prepending an
escape character (in effect, using escape as the \fImeta prefix\fP).
.TP
.B disable\-completion (Off)
If set to \fBOn\fP, readline will inhibit word completion.  Completion
characters will be inserted into the line as if they had been
mapped to \fBself-insert\fP.
.TP
.B editing\-mode (emacs)
Controls whether readline begins with a set of key bindings similar
to \fIemacs\fP or \fIvi\fP.
.B editing\-mode
can be set to either
.B emacs
or
.BR vi .
.TP
.B enable\-keypad (Off)
When set to \fBOn\fP, readline will try to enable the application
keypad when it is called.  Some systems need this to enable the
arrow keys.
.TP
.B expand\-tilde (Off)
If set to \fBon\fP, tilde expansion is performed when readline
attempts word completion.
.TP
.B horizontal\-scroll\-mode (Off)
When set to \fBOn\fP, makes readline use a single line for display,
scrolling the input horizontally on a single screen line when it
becomes longer than the screen width rather than wrapping to a new line.
.TP
.B input\-meta (Off)
If set to \fBOn\fP, readline will enable eight-bit input (that is,
it will not strip the high bit from the characters it reads),
regardless of what the terminal claims it can support.  The name
.B meta\-flag
is a synonym for this variable.
.TP
.B keymap (emacs)
Set the current readline keymap.  The set of legal keymap names is
\fIemacs, emacs\-standard, emacs\-meta, emacs\-ctlx, vi,
vi\-command\fP, and
.IR vi\-insert .
\fIvi\fP is equivalent to \fIvi\-command\fP; \fIemacs\fP is
equivalent to \fIemacs\-standard\fP.  The default value is
.IR emacs ;
the value of
.B editing\-mode
also affects the default keymap.
.TP
.B mark\-directories (On)
If set to \fBOn\fP, completed directory names have a slash
appended.
.TP
.B mark\-modified\-lines (Off)
If set to \fBOn\fP, history lines that have been modified are displayed
with a preceding asterisk (\fB*\fP).
.TP
.B output\-meta (Off)
If set to \fBOn\fP, readline will display characters with the
eighth bit set directly rather than as a meta-prefixed escape
sequence.
.TP
.B show\-all\-if\-ambiguous (Off)
This alters the default behavior of the completion functions.  If
set to
.BR on ,
words which have more than one possible completion cause the
matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell.
.TP
.B visible\-stats (Off)
If set to \fBOn\fP, a character denoting a file's type as reported
by \fIstat\fP(2) is appended to the filename when listing possible
completions.
.PD
.SS "Readline Conditional Constructs"
.PP
Readline implements a facility similar in spirit to the conditional
compilation features of the C preprocessor which allows key
bindings and variable settings to be performed as the result
of tests.  There are three parser directives used.
.IP \fB$if\fP
The 
.B $if
construct allows bindings to be made based on the
editing mode, the terminal being used, or the application using
readline.  The text of the test extends to the end of the line;
no characters are required to isolate it.
.RS
.IP \fBmode\fP
The \fBmode=\fP form of the \fB$if\fP directive is used to test
whether readline is in emacs or vi mode.
This may be used in conjunction
with the \fBset keymap\fP command, for instance, to set bindings in
the \fIemacs\-standard\fP and \fIemacs\-ctlx\fP keymaps only if
readline is starting out in emacs mode.
.IP \fBterm\fP
The \fBterm=\fP form may be used to include terminal-specific
key bindings, perhaps to bind the key sequences output by the
terminal's function keys.  The word on the right side of the
.B =
is tested against the full name of the terminal and the portion
of the terminal name before the first \fB\-\fP.  This allows
.I sun
to match both
.I sun
and
.IR sun\-cmd ,
for instance.
.IP \fBapplication\fP
The \fBapplication\fP construct is used to include
application-specific settings.  Each program using the readline
library sets the \fIapplication name\fP, and an initialization
file can test for a particular value.
This could be used to bind key sequences to functions useful for
a specific program.  For instance, the following command adds a
key sequence that quotes the current or previous word in Bash:
.RS
.nf
\fB$if\fP Bash
# Quote the current or previous word
"\eC\-xq": "\eeb\e"\eef\e""
\fB$endif\fP
.fi
.RE
.RE
.IP \fB$endif\fP
This command, as you saw in the previous example, terminates an
\fB$if\fP command.
.IP \fB$else\fP
Commands in this branch of the \fB$if\fP directive are executed if
the test fails.
.SS Searching
.PP
Readline provides commands for searching through the command history
(see
.SM
.B HISTORY
below) for lines containing a specified string.
There are two search modes:
.I incremental
and
.IR non-incremental .
.PP
Incremental searches begin before the user has finished typing the
search string.
As each character of the search string is typed, readline displays
the next entry from the history matching the string typed so far.
An incremental search requires only as many characters as needed to
find the desired history entry.
The Escape character is used to terminate an incremental search.
Control-J will also terminate the search.
Control-G will abort an incremental search and restore the original
line.
When the search is terminated, the history entry containing the
search string becomes the current line.
To find other matching entries in the history list, type Control-S or
Control-R as appropriate.
This will search backward or forward in the history for the next
entry matching the search string typed so far.
Any other key sequence bound to a readline command will terminate
the search and execute that command.
For instance, a \fInewline\fP will terminate the search and accept
the line, thereby executing the command from the history list.
.PP
Non-incremental searches read the entire search string before starting
to search for matching history lines.  The search string may be
typed by the user or part of the contents of the current line.
.SS "Readline Command Names"
.PP
The following is a list of the names of the commands and the default
key sequences to which they are bound.
Command names without an accompanying key sequence are unbound by default.

.SS Commands for Manipulating the History
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.B accept\-line (Newline, Return)
Accept the line regardless of where the cursor is.  If this line is
non-empty, add it to the history list according to the state of the
.SM
.B HISTCONTROL
variable.  If the line is a modified history
line, then restore the history line to its original state.
.TP
.B previous\-history (C\-p)
Fetch the previous command from the history list, moving back in
the list.
.TP
.B next\-history (C\-n)
Fetch the next command from the history list, moving forward in the

.TP
.B beginning\-of\-history (M\-<)
Move to the first line in the history.
.TP
.B end\-of\-history (M\->)
Move to the end of the input history, i.e., the line currently being
entered.
.TP
.B reverse\-search\-history (C\-r)
Search backward starting at the current line and moving `up' through
the history as necessary.  This is an incremental search.
.TP
.B forward\-search\-history (C\-s)
Search forward starting at the current line and moving `down' through
the history as necessary.  This is an incremental search.
.TP
.B non\-incremental\-reverse\-search\-history (M\-p)

using a non-incremental search for a string supplied by the user.
.TP
.B non\-incremental\-forward\-search\-history (M\-n)
Search forward through the history using a non-incremental search for
a string supplied by the user.
.TP
.B history\-search\-forward
Search forward through the history for the string of characters
between the start of the current line and the current cursor
position (the \fIpoint\fP).
This is a non-incremental search.
.TP
.B history\-search\-backward
Search backward through the history for the string of characters
between the start of the current line and the point.
This is a non-incremental search.
.TP
.B yank\-nth\-arg (M\-C\-y)
Insert the first argument to the previous command (usually
the second word on the previous line) at point (the current
cursor position).  With an argument
.IR n ,
insert the \fIn\fPth word from the previous command (the words
in the previous command begin with word 0).  A negative argument
inserts the \fIn\fPth word from the end of the previous command.
.TP

.SH HISTORY
When the
.B \-o history
option to the
.B set
builtin is enabled, the shell provides access to the
\fIcommand history\fP,
the list of commands previously typed.  The text of the last
.SM
.B HISTSIZE
commands (default 500) is saved in a history list.  The shell
stores each command in the history list prior to parameter and
variable expansion (see
.SM
.B EXPANSION
above) but after history expansion is performed, subject to the
values of the shell variables
.SM
.B HISTIGNORE
and
.SM
.BR HISTCONTROL .
On startup, the history is initialized from the file named by
the variable
.SM
.B HISTFILE
(default \fI~/.bash_history\fP).
.SM
.B HISTFILE
is truncated, if necessary, to contain no more than
.SM
.B HISTFILESIZE
lines.
When an interactive shell exits, the last
.SM
.B HISTSIZE
lines are copied from the history list to
.SM
.BR HISTFILE .
If the
.B histappend
shell option is enabled
(see the description of
.B shopt
under
.SM
.B "SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS"
below), the lines are appended to the history file,
otherwise the history file is overwritten.
If
.SM
.B HISTFILE
is unset, or if the history file is unwritable, the history is
not saved.  After saving the history, the history file is truncated
to contain no more than
.SM
.B HISTFILESIZE
lines.  If
.SM
.B HISTFILESIZE
is not set, no truncation is performed.
.PP
The builtin command
.B fc
(see
.SM
.B SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
below) may be used to list or edit and re-execute a portion of
the history list.
The
.B history
builtin can be used to display or modify the history list and
manipulate the history file.
When using the command-line editing, search commands
are available in each editing mode that provide access to the
history list.
.PP
The shell allows control over which commands are saved on the history
list.  The
.SM
.B HISTCONTROL
and
.SM
.B HISTIGNORE
variables may be set to cause the shell to save only a subset of the
commands entered.
The
.B cmdhist
shell option, if enabled, causes the shell to attempt to save each
line of a multi-line command in the same history entry, adding
semicolons where necessary to preserve syntactic correctness.
The
.B lithist
shell option causes the shell to save the command with embedded newlines
instead of semicolons.  See the description of the
.B shopt
builtin below under
.SM
.B "SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS"
for information on setting and unsetting shell options.
.SH "HISTORY EXPANSION"
.PP
The shell supports a history expansion feature that
is similar to the history expansion in
.BR csh.
This section describes what syntax features are available.  This
feature is enabled by default for interactive shells, and can be
disabled using the
.B \+H
option to the
.B set
builtin command (see
.SM
.B SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
below).  Non-interactive shells do not perform history expansion
by default.
.PP
History expansions introduce words from the history list into
the input stream, making it easy to repeat commands, insert the
arguments to a previous command into the current input line, or
fix errors in previous commands quickly.
.PP
History expansion is performed immediately after a complete line
is read, before the shell breaks it into words.
It takes place in two parts.
The first is to determine which line from the previous history
to use during substitution.
The second is to select portions of that line for inclusion into
the current one.
The line selected from the previous history is the \fIevent\fP,
and the portions of that line that are acted upon are \fIwords\fP.
Various \fImodifiers\fP are available to manipulate the selected words.
The line is broken into words in the same fashion as when reading input,
so that several \fImetacharacter\fP-separated words surrounded by
quotes are considered as one word.
History expansions are introduced by the appearance of the
history expansion character, which is \^\fB!\fP\^ by default.
Only backslash (\^\fB\e\fP\^) and single quotes can quote
the history expansion character.
.PP
Several shell options settable with the
.B shopt
builtin may be used to tailor the behavior of history expansion.
If the
.B histverify
shell option is enabled (see the description of the
.B shopt
builtin), and
.B readline
is being used, history substitutions are not immediately passed to
the shell parser.
Instead, the expanded line is reloaded into the
.B readline
editing buffer for further modification.
If
.B readline
is being used, and the
.B histreedit
shell option is enabled, a failed history substitution will be reloaded
into the
.B readline
editing buffer for correction.
The
.B \-p
option to the
.B history
builtin command may be used to see what a history expansion will
do before using it.
The
.B \-s
option to the
.B history
builtin may be used to add commands to the end of the history list
without actually executing them, so that they are available for
subsequent recall.
.PP
The shell allows control of the various characters used by the
history expansion mechanism (see the description of
.B histchars
above under
.BR "Shell Variables" ).

Shell variables are allowed as operands; parameter expansion is
performed before the expression is evaluated. 
The value of a parameter is coerced to a long integer within
an expression.  A shell variable need not have its integer attribute
turned on to be used in an expression.
.PP
Constants with a leading 0 are interpreted as octal numbers.
A leading 0x or 0X denotes hexadecimal.
Otherwise, numbers take the form [\fIbase#\fP]n, where \fIbase\fP
is a decimal number between 2 and 64 representing the arithmetic
base, and \fIn\fP is a number in that base.
If \fIbase\fP is omitted, then base 10 is used.
The digits greater than 9 are represented by the lowercase letters,
the uppercase letters, _, and @, in that order.
If \fIbase\fP is less than or equal to 36, lowercase and uppercase
letters may be used interchangably to represent numbers between 10
and 35.

When arguments are supplied, an alias is defined for
each \fIname\fP whose \fIvalue\fP is given.
A trailing space in  \fIvalue\fP causes the next word to be

otherwise.
If

the value of

.I optstring
contains the option letters to be recognized; if a letter

argument, which should be separated from it by white space.
Each time it is invoked,

places the next option in the shell variable
.IR name ,
initializing
.I name

.SM
.BR OPTIND .
.SM
.B OPTIND

is invoked.  When an option requires an argument,
.B getopts
places that argument into the variable
.SM
.BR OPTARG .
The shell does not reset
.SM
.B OPTIND
automatically; it must be manually reset between multiple
calls to
.B getopts
within the same shell invocation if a new set of parameters
is to be used.

.B getopts
can report errors in two ways.  If the first character of

error reporting is used.  In normal operation diagnostic messages

encountered.
If the variable
.SM
.B OPTERR

character of 
.I optstring

places ? into

prints an error message and unsets
.SM
.BR OPTARG .
If
.B getopts
is silent,
the option character found is placed in
.SM
.B OPTARG
and no diagnostic message is printed.
.sp 1
If a required argument is not found, and
.B getopts
is not silent,
a question mark (\^\fB?\fP\^) is placed in
.IR name ,
.B OPTARG
is unset, and a diagnostic message is printed.
If
.B getopts
is silent, then a colon (\^\fB:\fP\^) is placed in
.I name

.SM
.B OPTARG
is set to the option character found.
.sp 1
.B getopts
normally parses the positional parameters, but if more arguments are
given in

This includes aliases and functions,
if and only if the 
.B \-path
flag is not also used.
The table of hashed commands is not consulted
when using
.BR \-all .
.B type
accepts
.BR \-a ,
.BR \-t ,
and
.B \-p
in place of
.BR \-all ,
.BR \-type ,
and
.BR \-path ,
respectively.
.B type
returns true if any of the arguments are found, false if
none are found.
.TP
\fBulimit\fP [\fB\-SHacdflmnpstuv\fP [\fIlimit\fP]]
Provides control over the resources available to the shell and to
processes started by it, on systems that allow such control.  The
value of
.I limit
can be a number in the unit specified for the resource, or the
value
.BR unlimited .
The \fB\-H\fP and \fB\-S\fP options specify that the hard or soft limit is
set for the given resource.  A hard limit cannot be increased once it
is set; a soft limit may be increased up to the value of the hard limit.
If neither \fB\-H\fP nor \fB\-S\fP is specified, both the soft and hard
limits are set.
If
.I limit
is omitted, the current value of the soft limit of the resource is
printed, unless the \fB\-H\fP option is given.  When more than one
resource is specified, the limit name and unit are printed before the value.
Other options are interpreted as follows:
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B \-a
All current limits are reported
.TP
.B \-c
The maximum size of core files created
.TP
.B \-d
The maximum size of a process's data segment
.TP
.B \-f
The maximum size of files created by the shell
.TP
.B \-l
The maximum size that may be locked into memory
.TP
.B \-m
The maximum resident set size
.TP
.B \-n
The maximum number of open file descriptors (most systems do not
allow this value to be set)
.TP
.B \-p
The pipe size in 512-byte blocks (this may not be set)
.TP
.B \-s
The maximum stack size
.TP
.B \-t
The maximum amount of cpu time in seconds
.TP
.B \-u
The maximum number of processes available to a single user
.TP
.B \-v
The maximum amount of virtual memory available to the shell
.PD
.PP
If
.I limit
is given, it is the new value of the specified resource (the
.B \-a
option is display only).
If no option is given, then
.B \-f
is assumed.  Values are in 1024-byte increments, except for
.BR \-t ,
which is in seconds,
.BR \-p ,
which is in units of 512-byte blocks,
and
.B \-n
and
.BR \-u ,
which are unscaled values.  The return status is 0
unless an illegal option is encountered, a non-numeric argument
other than \fBunlimited\fP is supplied as \fIlimit\fP, or an
error occurs while setting a new limit.
.RE
.TP
\fBumask\fP [\fB\-S\fP] [\fImode\fP]
The user file-creation mask is set to 
.IR mode .
If
.I mode
begins with a digit, it
is interpreted as an octal number; otherwise
it is interpreted as a symbolic mode mask similar
to that accepted by
.IR chmod (1).
If
.I mode
is omitted, or if the 
.B \-S
option is supplied, the
current value of the mask is printed.
The
.B \-S
option causes the mask to be printed in symbolic form; the
default output is an octal number.
The return status is 0 if the mode was successfully changed or if
no \fImode\fP argument was supplied, and false otherwise.
.TP
\fBunalias\fP [\-\fBa\fP] [\fIname\fP ...]
Remove \fIname\fPs from the list of defined aliases.  If
.B \-a
is supplied, all alias definitions are removed.  The return
value is true unless a supplied
.I name
is not a defined alias.
.TP
\fBunset\fP [\-\fBfv\fP] [\fIname\fP ...]
For each
.IR name ,
remove the corresponding variable or function.
If no options are supplied, or the
.B \-v
option is given, each
.I name
refers to a shell variable.
Read-only variables may not be unset.
If
.B \-f
is specifed, 
each
.I name
refers to a shell function, and the function definition
is removed.
Each unset variable or function is removed from the environment
passed to subsequent commands.
If any of
.SM
.BR RANDOM ,
.SM
.BR SECONDS ,
.SM
.BR LINENO ,
.SM
.BR HISTCMD ,
or
.SM
.B DIRSTACK
are unset, they lose their special properties, even if they are
subsequently reset.  The exit status is true unless a
.I name
does not exist or is readonly.
.TP
\fBwait\fP [\fIn\fP]
Wait for the specified process and return its termination
status.
.I n
may be a process
ID or a job specification; if a job spec is given, all processes
in that job's pipeline are waited for.  If
.I n
is not given, all currently active child processes
are waited for, and the return status is zero.  If
.I n
specifies a non-existent process or job, the return status is
127.  Otherwise, the return status is the exit status of the last
process or job waited for.

.SH "RESTRICTED SHELL"
.PP
If
.B bash
is started with the name
.BR rbash ,
or the
.B \-r
option is supplied at invocation,
the shell becomes restricted.
A restricted shell is used to
set up an environment more controlled than the standard shell.
It behaves identically to
.B bash
with the exception that the following are disallowed:
.IP \(bu
changing directories with \fBcd\fP
.IP \(bu
setting or unsetting the values of
.B SHELL
or
.B PATH
.IP \(bu
specifying command names containing
.B /
.IP \(bu
specifying a file name containing a
.B /
as an argument to the
.B .
builtin command
.IP \(bu
importing function definitions from the shell environment at startup
.IP \(bu
redirecting output using the >, >|, <>, >&, &>, and >> redirection operators
.IP \(bu
using the
.B exec
builtin command to replace the shell with another command
.IP \(bu
adding or deleting builtin commands with the
.B \-f
and
.B \-d
options to the
.B enable
builtin command
.IP \(bu
specifying the
.B \-p
option to the
.B command
builtin command
.IP \(bu
turning off restricted mode with
.BR "set +r" .
.PP
These restrictions are enforced after any startup files are read.
.PP
When a command that is found to be a shell script is executed (see
.SM
.B "COMMAND EXECUTION"
above),
.B rbash
turns off any restrictions in the shell spawned to execute the
script.

.SH BUG REPORTS
If you find a bug in
.B bash,
you should report it.  But first, you should
make sure that it really is a bug, and that it appears in the latest
version of
.B bash
that you have.
.PP
Once you have determined that a bug actually exists, use the
.I bashbug
command to submit a bug report.
If you have a fix, you are encouraged to mail that as well!
Suggestions and `philosophical' bug reports may be mailed
to \fPbug-bash\fP@\fIprep.ai.MIT.Edu\fP or posted to the Usenet
newsgroup
.BR gnu.bash.bug .
.PP
ALL bug reports should include:

.SH BUGS
.PP
It's too big and too slow.
.PP
There are some subtle differences between 
.B bash
and traditional versions of
.BR sh ,
mostly because of the
.SM
.B POSIX
specification.
.PP
Aliases are confusing in some uses.
.PP
Shell builtin commands and functions are not stoppable/restartable.
.PP
Compound commands and command sequences of the form `a ; b ; c'
are not handled gracefully when process suspension is attempted.
When a process is stopped, the shell immediately executes the next
command in the sequence.
It suffices to place the sequence of commands between
parentheses to force it into a subshell, which may be stopped as
a unit.
.PP
Commands inside of \fB$(\fP...\fB)\fP command substitution are not
parsed until substitution is attempted.  This will delay error
reporting until some time after the command is entered.
.PP
Array variables may not (yet) be exported.
