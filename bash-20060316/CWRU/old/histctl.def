$PRODUCES histctl.c

$BUILTIN histctl
$FUNCTION histctl_builtin
$DEPENDS_ON HISTORY
$SHORT_DOC histctl [-cC] [-iI space|dups|both|none]
Control how lines are saved into the command history.  An option
of -c enables command-oriented history, in which all lines of a
compound command are saved as a single history entry.  The -i
option permits certain lines to be discarded without being stored
in the history: SPACE means to ignore lines beginning with a space;
DUPS means to ignore lines the same as the last command entered
into the history; BOTH enables SPACE and DUPS; and NONE means to
store all lines.
