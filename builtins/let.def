$BUILTIN let
$FUNCTION let_builtin
$PRODUCES let.c
$SHORT_DOC let arg [arg ...]
Each ARG is an arithmetic expression to be evaluated.  Evaluation
is done in long integers with no check for overflow, though division
by 0 is trapped and flagged as an error.  The following list of
operators is grouped into levels of equal-precedence operators.
The levels are listed in order of decreasing precedence.

	-, +		unary minus, plus
	!, ~		logical and bitwise negation
	*, /, %		multiplication, division, remainder
	+, -		addition, subtraction
	<<, >>		left and right bitwise shifts
	<=, >=, <, >	comparison
	==, !=		equality, inequality
	&		bitwise AND
	^		bitwise XOR
	|		bitwise OR
	&&		logical AND
	||		logical OR
	expr ? expr : expr
			conditional expression
	=, *=, /=, %=,
	+=, -=, <<=, >>=,
	&=, ^=, |=	assignment

Shell variables are allowed as operands.  The name of the variable
is replaced by its value (coerced to a long integer) within
an expression.  The variable need not have its integer attribute
turned on to be used in an expression.

Operators are evaluated in order of precedence.  Sub-expressions in
parentheses are evaluated first and may override the precedence
rules above.

If the last ARG evaluates to 0, let returns 1; 0 is returned
otherwise.
