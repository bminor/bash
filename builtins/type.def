$PRODUCES type.c

$BUILTIN type
$FUNCTION type_builtin
$SHORT_DOC type [-apt] name [name ...]
For each NAME, indicate how it would be interpreted if used as a
command name.

If the -t option is used, `type' outputs a single word which is one of
`alias', `keyword', `function', `builtin', `file' or `', if NAME is an
alias, shell reserved word, shell function, shell builtin, disk file,
or unfound, respectively.

If the -p flag is used, `type' either returns the name of the disk
file that would be executed, or nothing if `type -t NAME' would not
return `file'.

If the -a flag is used, `type' displays all of the places that contain
an executable named `file'.  This includes aliases and functions, if
and only if the -p flag is not also used.
