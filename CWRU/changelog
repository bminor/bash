				12/23/1996
				----------
[bash-2.0 released]

				   12/27
				   -----
configure.in
	- don't automatically use GNU malloc on FreeBSD, the builtin one
	  is supposed to be better (but doesn't have the debugging hooks)

builtins/exec.def
	- check that full_pathname(command) doesn't return NULL because of
	  inaccessible parent directories

support/config.sub
	- recognize OpenBSD

execute_cmd.c
	- broke the code that opens a file for output redirection when in
	  noclobber mode out into a separate function: noclobber_open().
	  This tries to avoid race conditions and file replacement between
	  stat(2) and open(2)

subst.c
	- make sure pat_subst does not run off the end of its return
	  string when copying the unmatched portion of the input string

				   12/30
				   -----
doc/Makefile.in
	- don't install readline.3 by default

lib/tilde/tilde.c
	- removed an unnecessary check for string[i] being non-null in
	  tilde_find_suffix

				   12/31
				   -----
support/config.{sub,guess}
	- merged in changes from config.sub in autoconf-2.12 distribution

lib/readline/readline.c
	- in rl_newline, only call _rl_vi_done_inserting and _rl_vi_reset_last
	  if readline is currently in vi mode

lib/readline/display.c
	- corrected a misuse of inv_lbreaks where vis_lbreaks was wanted in
	  the code that decides whether the cursor is at the beginning of
	  an otherwise-empty line

				    1/2
				    ---
support/bashbug.sh
	- fixed a typo, thanks to eggert@twinsun.com

aclocal.m4
	- new test, BASH_STRUCT_DIRENT_D_FILENO, testing for d_fileno member
	  of struct dirent

configure.in
	- call BASH_STRUCT_DIRENT_D_FILENO

config.h.in
	- new #define for STRUCT_DIRENT_HAS_D_FILENO

lib/posixheaders/posixdir.h
	- only define d_fileno as d_ino if STRUCT_DIRENT_HAS_D_INO is defined
	  and STRUCT_DIRENT_HAS_D_FILENO is not defined.  This fixed the
	  problem of compiling getcwd.c on SunOS4.1.4 with cc

				    1/3
				    ---
lib/readline/complete.c
	- fix a memory-used-after-freed bug reported by Andreas Schwab

configure.in
	- call BASH_CHECK_SOCKLIB only if getpeername is not found in libc
	  (ac_cv_func_getpeername = no)

				   1/13
				   ----

builtins/getopt.h
	- change #define guard to _SH_GETOPT_H to avoid similar guards in
	  /usr/include/getopt.h (Dec OSF/1 4.x, for example)

variables.h
	- fix assign_array_from_string so that it rejects attempts to assign
	  to readonly variables

subst.c
	- fix verify_substring_values to handle offsets that are past the
	  end or before the beginning (in the case of a negative offset)
	  of the expanded variable value

				   1/14
				   ----
bashline.c
	- fix a problem where any completion after a `cmd` command
	  substitution would inappropriately attempt command completion,
	  even if the previous command substitution was correctly closed

builtins/evalstring.c
	- unwind_protect remember_on_history even if the shell is not
	  interactive, since history can now be used in scripts, and
	  `source' will turn off interactive_shell before calling
	  parse_and_execute

jobs.c
	- new function get_job_by_pid(pid, block) to translate a pid to
	  a job number.  The block argument says whether or not to block
	  SIGCHLD

jobs.h
	- new extern declaration for get_job_by_pid

builtins/jobs.def
	- call get_job_by_pid if an argument appears to be a pid rather
	  than a jobspec

configure.in
	- configure --without-gnu-malloc automatically on MachTen 4.x

builtins/cd.def
	- change to mindist() so that a best guess of `.' returns 3,
	  which means not reasonable

lib/posixheaders/memalloc.h
	- changed hpux_9 to __hpux, since the new config stuff doesn't
	  define hpux_9

subst.c
	- fix parameter_brace_patsub to handle null patterns (doesn't
	  do anything)

oslib.c
	- slight change to bzero replacement

support/bashbug.sh
	- changed TEMP to be /tmp/bbug.$$ as a sop to systems with 14-char
	  file names

doc/bashref.texi
	- add note to POSIX Mode section that the output of `set' when
	  invoked without arguments is sorted when in POSIX mode

				   1/15
				   ----
support/recho.c
	- a couple of changes prompted by a `gcc -Wall'

subst.c
	- changed ASSIGN_RETURN macro to use the do...while(0) idiom to
	  avoid problems with its multiple statements

builtins/setattr.def
	- a bad identifier given to readonly or export without an assignment
	  statement (e.g. `readonly a[5]') is an error, but not an assignment
	  error (i.e., return EXECUTION_FAILURE rather than EX_BADASSIGN)

tests/{{array,new-exp}.,tilde-}tests
	- added `set +o posix' at the beginning to disable POSIX mode, which
	  causes some of the tests to fail.  Some systems (e.g. LINUX-FT),
	  set POSIXLY_CORRECT by default

tests/test-tests
	- added a warning if $UID is 0 to the effect that the test suite
	  should not be run as root
	- worked around the `noread' and `nowrite' tests failing when run
	  as root

test.c
	- began removing the remains of the STANDALONE code, since test is
	  included in GNU shellutils

				   1/16
				   ----
lib/readline/{readline,display}.c
	- a couple of slight changes to build on Win95 using djgpp (reported
	  by x-aes@telelogic.se)

Makefile.in
	- changed TERMCAP_LIBDIR to TERM_LIBDIR, so building the termcap
	  library (if necessary) should work now

bashline.c
	- new function: quote_word_break_characters(), to backslash-quote 
	  characters in a filename that the readline completion code would
	  treat as word breaks
	- change bash_quote_filename to call quote_word_break_characters if
	  the completion quoting style says to use backslashes
	- add `:' to rl_filename_quote_characters, since it's part of
	  filename_word_break_characters

lib/posixheaders/posixjmp.h
	- new file, with half of bashjmp.h
	- posixjmp.h and lib/readline/posixjmp.h are symlinks to this file

bashjmp.h
	- include "posixjmp.h" for possible redefinitions of setjmp/longjmp
	  and procenv_t

				   1/17
				   ----
shell.c
	- bad options now cause the standard shell usage message (a subset
	  of what `bash --help' prints) to be displayed on stderr

trap.c
	- don't free the trap command for a DEBUG trap in
	  restore_default_signal if SIG_INPROGRESS is set -- there's already
	  a pointer saved to the old value in _run_trap_internal.  This
	  makes bashdb run better, too

examples/bashdb/bashdb.{pre,fns}
	- a couple of minor fixes; it actually has a chance of working now

				   1/21
				   ----
config.h.in
	- add a define for <dlfcn.h>, HAVE_DLFCN_H

configure.in
	- look for <dlfcn.h>, define HAVE_DLFCN_H if found

builtins/enable.def
	- include <dlfcn.h> only if HAVE_DLFCN_H is defined

lib/readline/display.c
	- renamed clear_to_eol to _rl_clear_to_eol and made it global, so
	  other library files (readline.c) can use it
	- new function _rl_clear_screen, to clear the screen with the right
	  termcap escape sequence

lib/readline/readline.c
	- call _rl_clear_to_eol and _rl_clear_screen instead of using tputs
	- extern declarations for _rl_clear_to_eol and _rl_clear_screen

				   1/22
				   ----
mailcheck.c
	- fixed a problem in make_default_mailpath() where a slash was not
	  added between the default mail directory and the username

				   1/23
				   ----
stringlib.c
	- added a fourth parameter to ansicstr: the length of the returned
	  string

externs.h
	- changed declaration of ansicstr

parse.y
	- changed call to ansicstr -- saves a call to strlen

builtins/echo.def
	- changed call to ansicstr
	- if do_v9 is non-zero, use putchar to output the string instead
	  of printf, since there may be embedded NULL characters

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}, builtins/trap.def
	- modified the `trap' documentation to make it clearer that trap
	  takes multiple signal specs as arguments

jobs.c, nojobs.c, jobs.h
	- renamed initialize_jobs to initialize_job_control, added an
	  argument (force)

jobs.c
	- set shell_tty to fileno(stderr) in initialize_job_control if
	  the shell is not interactive.  This fixes the problem of bad
	  tty pgrps when monitor mode is turned on in a non-interactive
	  shell

sig.c
	- made initialize_terminating_signals do only that; moved the rest
	  of the code that used to be there into a new function:
	  initialize_shell_signals, which calls initialize_terminating_signals
	  if the shell is interactive
	- initialize_terminating_signals is now extern
	- made reset_terminating_signals return immediately if
	  termsigs_intitialized is zero, meaning that
	  initialize_terminating_signals has not been called

sig.h
	- new extern declaration for initialize_terminating_signals

trap.c
	- call initialize_terminating_signals from set_signal if sig is
	  EXIT_TRAP and the shell is not interactive.  Since the terminating
	  signals do not need to be initialized until a trap on exit is
	  set, not doing that at startup should result in a speed increase
	  for scripts

execute_cmd.c
	- save and restore command->flags in time_command, so you can use
	  `time command' in a loop

				   1/24
				   ----
lib/readline/display.c
	- fix redisplay code to wrap correctly if the prompt is longer than
	  the screen width (reported by bos@Eng.Sun.COM)

lib/readline/undo.c
	- don't include <setjmp.h>, it's not needed

lib/readline/{util,readline}.c
	- include "posixjmp.h" instead of <setjmp.h>
	- readline_top_level is now a `procenv_t' instead of a `jmp_buf'
	  (now readline uses the correct posix semantics for preserving
	  the signal mask and other things across longjmp)

parse.y
	- fixes to push_string/pop_string to make them more general -- they
	  now can be used generally, instead of having to be associated
	  with an alias being expanded
	- fixes to the parser so that it parses (( ls abc; ls def); ls ghi)
	  as a nested subshell command for backwards compatibility.  Broke
	  the double-paren expression parsing off into a new function:
	  parse_arith_cmd, called from read_token when a `((' is seen.  If
	  it looks like an arithmetic command, return `let' and set things
	  up so that the expression is returned as a double-quoted string
	  by the next call to read_token.  If it's a nested subshell, push
	  the text we parsed onto the list of strings for later consumption
	  and return `('

lib/glob/glob.c
	- fix glob_vector so it doesn't short-circuit checking a filename if
	  it starts with a `.' and the pattern starts with `\.' (if
	  noglob_dot_filenames is set).  This makes `".junk2"*' match
	  `.junk2.txt' correctly

				   1/27
				   ----
support/bashbug.sh
	- ask for confirmation before sending the bug report

builtins/fc.def
	- when editing and re-executing a multiline command, make sure
	  current_command_line_count is initialized and then incremented
	  for each line read from the file so that the lines added to
	  the history list by fc_replhist and fc_addhist obey the `lithist'
	  and `cmdhist' shopt options.  Reported by tibbitts@pb.seflin.org

				   1/28
				   ----
lib/readline/readline.h
	- added a couple of extern declarations for variables described in
	  the documentation but heretofore undeclared

builtins/ulimit.def
	- try to catch some classes of integer overflows before calling
	  set_limit

				   1/29
				   ----
parse.y
	- push and pop a `(' delimiter while parsing a $(...) construct, so
	  the history code doesn't try to inappropriately add a `;' when
	  a newline appears in the `...'

aclocal.m4
	- new macro, BASH_STRUCT_WINSIZE, which looks for `struct winsize'
	  in <sys/ioctl.h> (or one of the files it includes)

configure.in
	- call BASH_STRUCT_WINSIZE
	- slightly reorganized the calls to bash-specific macros

config.h.in
	- add an `#undef STRUCT_WINSIZE_IN_SYS_IOCTL'

jobs.c, nojobs.c
	- only look in sys/ptem.h for struct winsize if
	  STRUCT_WINSIZE_IN_SYS_IOCTL is not defined to cpp

				   1/30
				   ----
.{distribution,patchlevel}
	- renamed to _{distribution,patchlevel}

configure.in
	- create a variable BASHVERS, from the contents of _distribution,
	  and a variable BASHPATCH, from the contents of _patchlevel,
	  (using m4 magic so we don't have to distribute .distribution
	  and .patchlevel) and substitute them into Makefile.in

Makefile.in
	- use Version and PatchLevel variables instead of the contents of
	  .distribution and .patchlevel, respectively.  These are set by
	  configure
	- removed `.machine' from targets and dependencies

support/mkversion.sh
	- new shell script to handle updating version.h, replaces mkversion.c
	  (which is now overkill)

support/mkdist
	- don't bother with writing .distribution and .patchlevel files,
	  since they're no longer distributed

support/mknewvers.sh
	- simple bash script to make new version files.  It can increment
	  the major or minor version numbers or patchlevel, or take a
	  completely new version number (e.g., 2.01) as an argument

doc/Makefile.in
	- added support for the `install-info' command to update the info
	  directory file after installing bash.info

				   1/31
				   ----
builtins/help.def
	- fix core dump with `help --'

susbt.c
	- make call_expand_word_internal obey the convention that if
	  expand_word_internal returns &expand_word_{fatal,error}, then
	  w->word has already been freed
	- return &expand_word_fatal from expand_word_internal if the shell
	  is not interactive and `set -u' has been executed

test.c, general.c
	- moved group_member from test.c to general.c

externs.h, general.h
	- moved extern declaration of group_member from externs.h to general.h

general.c
	- broke the code that initializes the group array out into a new
	  function, initialize_group_array()
	- initialize_group_array() now initializes an array even if the OS
	  does not have getgroups().  If it does not, an array with one
	  element (the real gid) is created
	- call sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX) if sysconf is available and
	  _SC_NGROUPS_MAX is defined
	- new function, char **get_group_list(int *), to return an array
	  of strings made from the groups list

variables.c
	- new dynamic array variable: GROUPS, expands to the group set as
	  obtained with getgroups() (or whatever initialize_group_array()
	  makes)

doc/{bash.{1,html},bashref.texi}
	- added description of GROUPS variable

test/test-tests
	- before modifying the setgid bit on /tmp/setgid, try to change its
	  group to ${GROUPS[0]} 

				    2/3
				    ---
aclocal.m4
	- new autconf macro, BASH_MISC_SPEED_T, to see if speed_t is defined
	  in <sys/types.h>

configure.in
	- call BASH_MISC_SPEED_T

config.h.in
	- add `#undef SPEED_T_IN_SYS_TYPES'

lib/readline/tcap.h
	- include `rltty.h' if HAVE_TERMCAP_H and __linux__ are defined, but
	  SPEED_T_IN_SYS_STYPES is not, before including <termcap.h>

support/mksignames.c, siglist.c
	- add support for 4.4 BSD SIGLOST

support/config.guess
	- add support for recognizing QNX based on `uname' output

Makefile.in
	- make sure recho and zecho are compiled with the same set of CC
	  options as the rest of the sources

lib/readline/bind.c
	- change calls to rl_generic_bind to cast the third argument to
	  (char *) where necessary

command.h
	- two new flags: CMD_AMPERSAND (currently unused), and CMD_STDIN_REDIR,
	  which means that this command should have its standard input
	  redirected from /dev/null if there are not any explicit redirections
	  to stdin

execute_cmd.c
	- a redirection of type r_inputa_direction is no longer added at the
	  beginning of the redirection chain for an async command;
	  CMD_STDIN_REDIR is set in the flags instead
	- new function: stdin_redirects: returns the number of redirections to
	  stdin in a chain of redirections
	- new functions: async_redirect_stdin() to open /dev/null and make it
	  file descriptor 0
	- changes to make CMD_STDIN_REDIR propagate to all of the necessary
	  functions (like execute_simple_command)
	- execute_disk command now takes the flags from simple_command rather
	  than just the CMD_NO_FORK flag as its last argument
	- various places after make_child is executed (in the child) check for
	  CMD_STDIN_REDIRECT (and no stdin redirections or piping) and call
	  async_redirect_stdin
	- stdin_redir is now global

eval.c
	- set stdin_redir to 0 just before calling execute_command so it
	  gets reset to a known value and doesn't persist across commands

				    2/4
				    ---
builtins/ulimit.def
	- add a stub function for ulimit(2) on systems without HAVE_RESOURCE
	  or HAVE_ULIMIT that just sets errno to EINVAL and returns -1 --
	  QNX is one such system

bashhist.c
	- pre_process_line needs to protect all occurrences of hist_verify
	  with #ifdef READLINE

builtins/shopt.def
	- hist_verify needs to be protected with #ifdef READLINE, not
	  #ifdef HISTORY

				    2/5
				    ---
support/config.{guess,sub}, configure.in
	- chages to better support the Harris Night Hawk

[many files]
	- changes for things pointed out by gcc -Wall

lib/glob/Makefile.in
	- make sure -DSHELL is included in CCFLAGS so that globbing is
	  interruptible

lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- extern declaration for botch: if botch is #defined, it should be
	  the name of a void function

configure.in,Makefile.in,builtins/Makefile.in,
lib/{glob,malloc,readline,tilde}/Makefile.in
	- add a LOCAL_DEFS variable, substituted from configure into the
	  various Makefiles.  It's set to -DSHELL, so that define gets
	  passed to all sub-makes without doing anything special

lib/readline/readline.c
	- change to rl_digit_loop to make it compatible with GNU emacs:
	  if a key bound to `universal-argument' is read after reading
	  some digits, it terminates the argument but is otherwise
	  ignored.  This is how people can insert repeated digits

doc/{bash.{1,html},readline.3}, lib/readline/doc/rluser.texinfo
	- changed description of `universal-argument' to describe how
	  to terminate a numeric argument

				    2/6
				    ---
jobs.c
	- changed kill_pid to diddle the job and process data structures
	  if we're sending SIGCONT to a stopped job with `kill' so that
	  the shell knows the job is running again.  ksh93 does this

				    2/7
				    ---
unwind_prot.c
	- changed bcopy to FASTCOPY

builtins/enable.def
	- changed pointer arithmetic in delete_builtin to just subtract
	  the head of the builtins list (shell_builtins) from a pointer
	  to the builtin to be deleted (b) to find its index in the list
	  on ANSI C systems

				   2/10
				   ----
lib/readline/bind.c
	- when using old-style keynames to bind to a new-style macro,
	  pass an array of type (unsigned char *) to rl_macro_bind

builtins/getopt.c
	- change sh_getopt to return EOF if nextchar is empty or NULL
	  and sh_optind is greater than argc.  This can happen if a
	  script mixes calls to `getopts' with calls to `shift'

				   2/11
				   ----
print_cmd.c
	- fixed make_command_string_internal so that commands with the
	  CMD_TIME_POSIX flag set print `time -p' instead of `time'
	- changed print_redirection_list so the here documents are
	  printed after all the other redirections, and followed by a
	  newline (rather than a possible semicolon)
	- added a new variable, was_heredoc, to avoid adding a semicolon
	  at the beginning of an empty line after printing the heredoc
	  ending delimiter

execute_cmd.c
	- don't put the gnu_argv_flags into the environment any more; it's
	  proven to be a bad idea

configure.in
	- set LOCAL_CFLAGS to `-DSunOS5' on Solaris 5.5[.x]

builtins/echo.def
	- only call fflush() after printing each word on SunOS 5.5, since
	  that's the system with the bug that prompted its inclusion in
	  the first place

support/mksignames.c
	- added support for more system-specific signals from AIX 4.2,
	  changed initialization order so that system-specific signals
	  are done first, before the common signals

				   2/12
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- broke the code that creates a file containing the text of a
	  here document out into a separate function: here_doc_to_fd
	- create the temp file used for a here document with mode 600
	- open the temp file used for a here document with O_EXCL

shell.h
	- changed the uid members of struct user_info to be of type uid_t
	  and the gid members to be of type gid_t

parse.y
	- changed the type of the `type' argument to init_yy_io() to be
	  `enum stream_type', since that's what's always passed

input.h
	- changed the function prototype for init_yy_io so the third arg is
	  type `enum stream_type'

externs.h
	- added a prototype for getcwd, if HAVE_GETCWD is not defined

builtins/umask.def
	- changed all variables that are used as arguments to or save the
	  return value from umask(2) to be of type mode_t
	- changed print_symbolic_umask to take an argument of type mode_t

				   2/13
				   ----
jobs.c
	- if old_sigint_handler is set to SIG_DFL, as it will be in a script
	  without a trap on SIGINT installed, call termination_unwind_protect()
	  directly from waitchld()

				   2/14
				   ----
configure.in
	- added a section before the call to BASH_CHECK_LIB_TERMCAP to
	  set a variable prefer_curses on some systems (AIX, for one)

aclocal.m4
	- in BASH_CHECK_LIB_TERMCAP, don't return -ltermcap if $prefer_curses
	  is non-empty

lib/readline/Makefile.in
	- redid the dependencies

				   2/17
				   ----
hashlib.c, getcwd.c
	- include `bashansi.h' instead of stdlib.h and string.h

error.c, siglist.c, xmalloc.c, builtins/{common,evalfile,mkbuiltins,psize}.c,
builtins/{exec,exit,fg_bg,hash,history}.def
	- include `bashtypes.h' instead of directly including <sys/types.h> 

builtins/fc.def
	- include ../bashtypes.h and ../posixstat.h instead of bashtypes.h
	  and posixstat.h

builtins/mkbuiltins.c
	- include ../posixstat.h instead of <sys/stat.h>

general.h
	- include `bashtypes.h' if RLIMTYPE is defined, so we can fetch
	  a definition of quad_t (or whatever) from <sys/types.h> before
	  using it in a function prototype

Makefile.in, builtins/Makefile.in
	- updated dependencies

				   2/18
				   ----
builtins/set.def
	- new function, set_posix_mode, called when `set [-+]o posix'
	  or `shopt -[su] -o posix' is executed.  It sets or unsets
	  $POSIXLY_CORRECT and calls sv_strict_posix

subst.c
	- in sv_strict_posix, call posix_readline_initialize only if
	  the shell is interactive (interactive_shell != 0)

shell.c
	- if we are acting like `sh', call posix_readline_initialize
	  if the shell is interactive
	- moved the code that does posix.2 mode initialization after
	  interactive_shell is set, and call posix_readline_initialize
	  if interactive_shell is non-zero

bashwait.h
	- renamed to unionwait.h, since that is what it defines

posixwait.h
	- moved the POSIX 1003.1 job control defines here from jobs.h

jobs.h
	- include `posixwait.h'

				   2/19
				   ----
braces.c
	- if SHELL is defined, pass the contents of new-style command
	  substitution through without expanding brace constructs between
	  the parens -- let the subshell do it

subst.c
	- when brace-expanding words, preserve the flags (word->flags) if
	  brace expansion does not change the word.  This fixes the problem
	  of things like

		 local -a avar=( ${PATH//: } );

bashline.c
	- have shell_expand_line pass a copy of rl_line_buffer to expand_string
	  in case there are substitution errors and the string gets freed

				   2/20
				   ----
expr.c
	- make sure that expland and explor set `lasttok' to LAND and LOR,
	  respectively, if they parse `&&' or `||'.  This makes the
	  precedence code work right

subst.c
	- changes so that non-interactive shells exit immediately when a
	  parameter that is unset is referenced after `set -u' has been
	  executed causes the shell to exit immediately

				   2/21
				   ----
flags.c
	- if `set -r' is executed, call maybe_make_restricted so that $PATH
	  and $SHELL are made read-only

execute_cmd.c
	- if `set -e' has been executed, and we're inverting a pipeline's
	  return status with `!', set CMD_IGNORE_RETURN so a failing
	  command does not inadvertently cause the shell to exit before
	  the exit status can be inverted.  This is probably only a problem
	  with the `eval' builtin.

				   2/24
				   ----
builtins/hash.def
	- add a missing argument of 0 to add_hashed_command

builtins/kill.def
	- job identifiers can be used in non-interactive shells as long as
	  job control has been turned on with `set -m'

jobs.c
	- we want to be notified of stopped jobs if job_control is non-zero,
	  even if the shell is not interactive

execute_cmd.c
	- make sure shell_execve returns EX_NOTFOUND if execve fails and
	  errno is set to ENOENT
	- makes sure execute_builtin saves the temporary environment to
	  builtin_env for the `eval' builtin, since it can destroy the
	  temporary environment when it calls parse_and_execute

bashhist.c
	- new variable: hist_last_line_added, set to 1 if the last command
	  line was added to the history successfully as a separate entry.
	  Used by `history' and `fc'

				   2/25
				   ----
trap.c
	- save line number before executing trap command, because
	  parse_and_execute resets it to 1 and the trap command might
	  want it

execute_cmd.c
	- change to executing_line_number to return trap_line_number if
	  the shell is currently running a trap

				   2/26
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- change to time_command so that a `real' value of 0 does not
	  cause a divide-by-zero error when computing cpu percentage

lib/readline/signals.c
	- if MUST_REINSTALL_SIGHANDLERS is defined, reinstall the SIGWINCH
	  handler in rl_handle_sigwinch

builtins/set.def
	- `unset' now rejects attempts to unset names that are not valid
	  shell identifiers as errors
	- add a description of `-o history' option to help text

subst.c
	- in parameter_brace_patsub, we want backslash removal done on
	  the replacement if (mflags & MATCH_QUOTED), since the code
	  in expand_word_internal will not do it.  We need to call
	  expand_string_unsplit directly, since maybe_expand_string does
	  not do the right thing

				   2/28
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- if execute_for_command finds that the iteration variable is readonly,
	  decrement loop_level before returning

builtins/break.def
	- if the break count is <= 0, display an error message and break out
	  of all loops

builtins/command.def
	- if PATH is unset, and we're using command -p, we don't want PATH
	  to be set to the empty string when `command' completes

builtins/common.c
	- POSIX.2 says `kill -l signum' prints the signal name without the
	  leading `SIG' prefix, so check for this_shell_builtin == kill_builtin
	  in display_signal_list

builtins/getopts.def
	- when invoked without any arguments, `getopts' now prints a usage
	  message

				    3/3
				    ---
builtins/common.c
	- add a second argument to get_numeric_arg: if non-zero, the shell
	  exits on a bad argument; if not, the shell jumps to top_level
	  with a DISCARD argument, which aborts the current command

builtins/{break,exit,history,return,shift}.def
	- change calls to get_numeric_argument

lib/readline/funmap.c
	- add `dump-macros' to list of bindable names

lib/readline/readline.h
	- added extern declaration for rl_prompt (it was apparently missing)

lib/readline/readline.c
	- new internal function, _rl_init_line_state, which sets rl_point
	  and rl_end to 0, sets the_line to point to _rl_line_buffer, and
	  clears the line

lib/readline/callback.c
	- if a user's callback function does not clear the line, clear it
	  for him by calling _rl_init_line_state

				    3/4
				    ---
alias.c
	- made the readline support functions #ifdef READLINE, so they're
	  not compiled into the shell unless readline is

lib/readline/bind.c
	- new function _rl_untranslate_macro_value, to expand meta-prefixes
	  and other special characters in a macro value for printing by
	  _rl_macro_dumper_internal
	- call _rl_untranslate_macro_value in _rl_macro_dumper_internal to
	  get a printable version of the macro value

lib/readline/readline.c
	- new variable, rl_dispatching, set to 1 when we call a function
	  from _rl_dispatch

lib/readline/readline.h
	- extern declaration for rl_dispatching

lib/readline/complete.c
	- make sure S_ISCHR and S_ISBLK are defined before using them

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- add a new #define NEED_EXTERN_PC.  Define this if the termcap
	  or curses libraries need `extern' before declarations of PC,
	  BC, and UP

lib/readline/{readline,terminal,histfile}.c
	- changes to compile on OS/2 with OS/2 `EMX' port of gcc, originally
	  sent by ilya@math.ohio-state.edu

builtins/set.def
	- fixed a bug in set_shellopts that caused the shell to crash if
	  there were no shell options set

				    3/5
				    ---
configure.in,Makefile.in
	- choose run-all or run-minimal as the test script based on whether
	  the --enable-minimal-config option was given to configure

builtins/setattr.def
	- fixed `export -p' and `readonly -p' so that they output `export'
	  or `readonly' when in POSIX mode, as POSIX.2 specifies

				    3/6
				    ---
builtins/setattr.def
	- make `readonly -a var=(...)' work just like `declare -ar var=(...)',
	  since the two logically mean the same
	- `readonly -f' and `export -f' don't print the function definition
	  for each readonly or exported function, respectively, when in
	  POSIX mode

jobs.c, nojobs.c
	- don't report status for processes killed by SIGPIPE if
	  DONT_REPORT_SIGPIPE is defined

config.h.top
	- added a commented-out define for DONT_REPORT_SIGPIPE

execute_cmd.c
	- `time' can now be used to time background pipelines, and reports
	  the timing statistics when the pipeline completes

[bash-2.01-alpha1 frozen]

				   3/12
				   ----
subst.c
	- move the parent end of the pipe file descriptor used for process
	  substitution to a high, unused file descriptor to avoid clashes
	  with redirections performed explicitly by a script

configure.in
	- added a `--with-curses' argument so curses can be forcibly chosen
	  over libtermcap (some Unix versions ship lousy termcap databases)

support/mkconffiles
	- new script to create _distribution and _patchlevel from values
	  contained in `configure'

doc/bashref.texi
	- updated installation instructions

				   3/13
				   ----
general.c
	- if `getgroups' returns 0, make sure we add the primary group id
	  as GROUPS[0].
	- if we have getgroups, and the primary gid is not in the array
	  getgroups returns, add it as group_array[0] and shuffle everything
	  up one element.  This ensures that current_user.gid == group_array[0]
	  all the time

tests/builtins.tests
	- changes to avoid stray variables in environment when the shell
	  version of printenv is used with bash as /bin/sh, running the
	  `exec -c' tests.

				   3/14
				   ----
builtins/cd.def
	- spelling correction is no longer enabled by default

support/bashbug.sh
	- if the shell's release status is alpha or beta, offer the option
	  of sending the bug report to the bash-testers mailing list as
	  well as to chet

				   3/17
				   ----
configure.in
	- configure --without-gnu-malloc by default on *-sgi-irix6* because
	  their code needs 8-byte alignment

support/bashbug.sh
	- ``' needs to be quoted with a backslash in double-quoted strings

aclocal.m4
	- slight changes to the strcoll test, since AIX 4.2 returns -1, 0, or
	  1 from strcmp(3) but a numeric collation order difference from
	  strcoll(3)

				   3/18
				   ----
command.h
	- new redirection error code:  HEREDOC_REDIRECT

execute_cmd.c
	- return HEREDOC_REDIRECT from do_redirection_internal when
	  here_document_to_fd cannot create the temp file for a here document
	- changed redirection_error to print a meaningful message when
	  here document temp file creation fails (HEREDOC_REDIRECT)

				   3/19
				   ----
subst.c
	- changes to match_pattern_char: return 1 if the first char of the
	  pattern is `?' only if the string is non-null; just return 1 if
	  the first char of the pattern is `[' and the string is non-empty
	  rather than try to re-implement the brace matching code from fnmatch

lib/glob/fnmatch.c
	- some changes from glibc-2.0.1 posix/fnmatch.c

				   3/21
				   ----
variables.c
	- only do the initialization of `ignoreeof' if the shell is
	  interactive
	- reset values of $SHLVL > 1000 to 1 in adjust_shell_level, and
	  don't call itos, since we don't need its generality
	- new function, initialize_shell_level, just calls adjust_shell_level
	  with argument of 1.  If $SHLVL is unset, adjust_shell_level will
	  deal with it correctly
	- change initialize_shell_variables to not malloc a copy of each
	  environment variable, just keep two pointers into the env string:
	  one for the name, one for the value
	- broke the code that computes the value of $BASH out into a separate
	  function: get_bash_name
	- get_bash_name special-cases shell_name with a `./' prefix when
	  initializing $BASH
	- new function: set_home_var, sets $HOME to current_user.home_dir if
	  it's not already set, calling get_current_user_info if
	  current_user.home_dir is NULL
	- new function: set_shell_var, sets $SHELL to current_user.shell if
	  it's not already set, calling get_current_user_info if
	  current_user.shell is NULL
	- changed places that reference information in current_user to check
	  for NULL values of the member they're interested in and call
	  get_current_user_info if necessary

shell.c
	- moved the code that sets up the information in current_user that
	  comes from the password file into a new function,
	  get_current_user_info
	- shell_initialize calls get_current_user_info only if the shell is
	  interactive

externs.h
	- new extern declaration for get_current_user_info(), so variables.c
	  can use it

				   3/24
				   ----
lib/tilde/tilde.c
	- if SHELL is defined, user the current_user struct info to find
	  the user's home directory rather than calling getpwuid

				   3/25
				   ----
nojobs.c
	- don't try to open /dev/tty when getting or setting the tty state
	  and window size; use shell_tty instead
	- initialize shell_tty to standard error in initialize_job_control
	- only fetch the tty state initially if the shell is interactive

general.c
	- open /dev/tty with the O_NONBLOCK flag

variables.c
	- changed all_vars so that it sorts its output all the time, not
	  just when in POSIX mode.  This means that the output of `set'
	  and `export' will be sorted

builtins/set.def
	- in initialize_shell_options, only call parse_shellopts if we
	  inherited $SHELLOPTS from the environment
	- make sure we call parse_shellopts from initialize_shell_options
	  with a copy of the value of SHELLOPTS, in case one of the functions
	  called while setting one of the variables modifies $SHELLOPTS

lib/readline/readline.c
	- make sure that digit arguments don't change the state of
	  rl_last_func

support/printenv.c
	- new file, printenv(1) clone, used to avoid environment variables
	  that might be set automatically when using printenv.sh

lib/tilde/tilde.c
	- if SHELL is defined, don't call getenv to get the value of $HOME,
	  call get_string_value () directly

				   3/26
				   ----
lib/readline/histexpand.c
	- abstracted the `#ifdef SHELL' stuff that checked for special cases
	  that should not be history expanded ([!...], ${!...}) into a call
	  to a function that is the value of the
	  new history_inhibit_expansion_function variable

lib/readline/history.h
	- extern declaration for history_inhibit_expansion_function

bashhist.c
	- new function, bash_history_inhibit_expansion, which checks for
	  the special cases in which history expansion should be inhibited
	- changes to the various history initialization functions to
	  set history_inhibit_expansion_function

lib/readline/doc/hstech.texinfo
	- documented history_inhibit_expansion_function

lib/readline/shell.c
	- new file, containing versions of the functions that are provided
	  by bash when readline is linked as part of bash
	- new function: get_env_value().  If SHELL is defined, this calls
	  get_string_value().  If SHELL is not defined, this calls getenv()

lib/readline/histexpand.c
	- moved single_quote() to shell.c

lib/readline/util.c
	- moved savestring() to shell.c

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- moved set_lines_and_columns() to shell.c

lib/readline/Makefile.in, Makefile.in
	- added shell.c and shell.o to the appropriate variables that contain
	  the files comprising the readline and history libraries

lib/readline/signals.c
	- introduced two new cpp defines:  HANDLE_JOB_SIGNALS and
	  HANDLE_SIGTERM.  When HANDLE_JOB_SIGNALS is defined, SIGTSTP,
	  SIGTTIN, and SIGTTOU are caught and handled.  When HANDLE_SIGTERM
	  is defined, SIGTERM is caught and handled.  These are both
	  defined automatically if SHELL is not defined

lib/readline/{bind,histfile,nls,readline,terminal}.c
	- call get_env_value instead of getenv().  This should remove the
	  dependency on being able to redefine getenv() in oslib.c

shell.c
	- added a missing argument of -1 to the call to list_minus_o_opts.
	  Now `bash -o' lists all options, not just random ones depending
	  on what's on the stack

				   3/28
				   ----
builtins/ulimit.def
	- change RLIM_INFINITY to the hard limit only if the hard limit is
	  greater than the current (soft) limit

hashlib.c
	- return immediately from flush_hash_table if the hash table passed
	  is NULL

				    4/1
				    ---
shell.c
	- remove call to initialize_filename_hashing -- initialize the hash
	  table the first time a hashed command has to be remembered

hashcmd.c
	- new file, with functions to perform filename hashing and lookup
	  taken from builtins/hash.def and builtins/common.c
	- change to remember_filename -- call initialize_filename_hashing
	  if hashing_initialized is 0

hashcmd.h
	- new file, mostly from builtins/hashcom.h, with extern function
	  declarations added

execute_cmd.c, builtins/{hash,type}.def
	- include hashcmd.h for hash function and type definitions

builtins/{common.{c,h},hash.def}
	- moved hashing functions and declarations to hashcmd.c/hashcmd.h

Makefile.in, builtins/Makefile.in
	- changed source and object file definitions and dependencies because
	  of addition of hashcmd.h and hashcmd.c

builtins/hash.def
	- return immediately from print_hashed_commands if hashed_commands
	  is empty, indicating that the hash table has not been initialized

				    4/2
				    ---
lib/readline/bind.c
	- fixed translation of ESC in rl_untranslate_keyseq and
	  rl_untranslate_macro_value

lib/readline/{readline,kill}.c
	- added an argument to _rl_fix_point telling it whether or not to
	  fix up the mark also; changed calls to _rl_fix_point to add the
	  appropriate argument

Makefile.in
	- changed the substitution delimiter in the `sed' commands that
	  create bashbug from `:' to `%' to avoid conflicts with options
	  containing `:'

				    4/3
				    ---
print_cmd.c
	- made the initial value and the default growth value for the
	  printed command somewhat smaller -- we don't really need to
	  allocate 4096 bytes for the printed command
	- added stdarg support to xprintf if PREFER_STDARG is defined

stringlib.c
	- changed strip_trailing to take the index of the last character
	  as the second argument, saving a (useless) call to strlen, since
	  the caller already knows where the end of the string is

subst.c
	- change call to strip_trailing in command_substitute to add the
	  new second argument

externs.h
	- changed extern declaration for strip_trailing

				    4/4
				    ---
Makefile.in, configure.in, lib/malloc/Makefile.in
	- changed the strategy for picking which `malloc' to include by
	  having configure define a `malloc target' and the Makefile in
	  lib/malloc implementing rules for that target

				    4/5
				    ---
Makefile.in
	- slightly changed the rules for remaking `parser-built':  it is
	  now a copy of y.tab.h, updated only when the contents of y.tab.h
	  change
	- everything that used to depend on y.tab.h now depends on
	  parser-built

				    4/6
				    ---
execute_cmd.c, print_cmd.c
	- use #include <y.tab.h> so we pick up y.tab.h from the build
	  directory instead of the source directory if it happens to be
	  recreated in the build directory

				    4/7
				    ---
bashline.c
	- fixed another problem with `pwd`/[TAB] thinking that the `/
	  started an unclosed command substitution, generating errors

				    4/8
				    ---
general.c
	- renamed bash_tilde_expansion_failure_hook to be
	  bash_special_tilde_expansions, since that more accurately reflects
	  its function
	- changed tilde_initialize so that there is no failure hook -- the
	  special expansions are handled first with the preexpansion hook

lib/tilde/tilde.c
	- new variable: tilde_expansion_preexpansion_hook -- if non-null, it
	  points to a function that is called before standard tilde expansion
	  is attempted

lib/tilde/tilde.h
	- extern declaration for tilde_expansion_preexpansion_hook

doc/{bash.{1,html},bashref.texi}
	- added optional open paren to description of `case' command syntax

				    4/9
				    ---
variables.c
	- on qnx, set and export a variable `NODE' which contains the QNX
	  `node id'

general.c
	- QNX system can now handle pathnames with a leading `//'

configure.in
	- added `-Dqnx' to LOCAL_CFLAGS on QNX machines

lib/malloc/getpagesize.h
	- some systems need sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE) to obtain the page size;
	  added code to check for it

				   4/10
				   ----
print_cmd.c
	- include the prototype for cprintf only if PREFER_STDARG is defined,
	  otherwise just have a K&R-style forward function declaration

hashlib.h
	- reduced the default number of buckets in a hash table to 53

lib/tilde/tilde.c
	- prime the result string in tilde_expand by allocating a new string
	  that's as long as the input string (+16 if a tilde appears in
	  the string to be expanded).  This should reduce the number of
	  reallocs

subst.c
	- broke the code that reads the output of a command substitution
	  through the pipe to the subshell out into a separate function:
	  read_comsub().  This does not use stdio, but rather reads
	  directly from the pipe into a local 128-character buffer

				   4/11
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- some systems need both <sys/time.h> and <time.h>, so include both
	  if it's possible, otherwise include <sys/time.h> (if present)

lib/readline/rl{tty,defs}.h
	- moved includes of <sys/stream.h>, <sys/ptem.h>, etc. to rltty.h

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- include rltty.h after rldefs.h

variables.c
	- changes to make environment creation faster and use less memory
	  (fewer malloc/free calls, too):

		o two new variables: export_env_index (how many environment
		  strings are in export_env) and export_env_size (the
		  number of slots for strings allocated in export_env)
		o added new function add_to_export_env, since adding the
		  exported shell variables and shell functions does not
		  need to search the export_env for a definition to supersede
		  (we just cleared it out!)
		o renamed add_or_supersede to add_or_supersede_exported_var,
		  since it always works on export_env, and changed the second
		  argument to a flag saying whether or not to allocate a new
		  copy of the string placed into the environment
		o changed calls to add_or_supersede to the new
		  add_or_supersede_exported_var with the appropriate flags
		o don't free and reallocate export_env in maybe_make_export_env,
		  just free the strings and start anew
		o prime the size of export_env from the total number of shell
		  variables and shell functions -- this will always be enough
		  for the exported shell functions and variables, and big
		  enough most of the time for the entire environment

builtins/cd.def
	- efficiency hack in bindpwd():  if PWD is exported, we will have to
	  rebuild the entire exported environment after every time we change
	  directories.  What we do is see if array_needs_making changes value
	  from 0 to 1 after bind_variable ("PWD", dirname) is called, and
	  that PWD is exported.  If that happens, we just replace the value
	  of PWD in the exported environment with a call to
	  add_or_supersede_exported_var

bashline.c, parse.y
	- check calls to pre_process_line to make a fresh copy of the line
	  if pre_process_line returns what it was passed, in preparation
	  for future changes

bashhist.c
	- pre_process_line now returns its argument if it did not make
	  any changes to it

alias.c
	- free the bucket entry holding the alias to be removed in
	  remove_alias, as well as the data

				   4/14
				   ----
unwind_prot.c
	- if an unwind-protect frame is being discarded, and its cleanup
	  function is `restore_variable', the `arg' member points to a
	  SAVED_VAR that must be freed.  This change is made in
	  remove_unwind_protect_internal and unwind_frame_discard_internal

parse.y
	- need to free memory allocated by parse_arith_cmd if it is an
	  arithmetic command, after using it to make a new word

subst.c
	- fixed some memory leaks caused by not freeing the argument to
	  make_bare_word, which duplicates its string argument
	- need to dispose list generated by list_rest_of_args in
	  paramter_list_remove_pattern
	- make sure the return value from getpattern() is freed
	- make sure array_value_internal always returns newly-allocated
	  memory
	- get_var_and_type returns a new type: VT_ARRAYMEMBER if the
	  string passed is of the form var[index]
	- make sure parameter_brace_substring frees the memory allocated
	  by get_var_and_type if verify_substring_values returns 0

hashlib.c, hashlib.h
	- new function, dispose_hash_table (table), which frees the
	  table's bucket array and the table itself

alias.c
	- call dispose_hash_table from delete_all_aliases instead of just
	  freeing the table

pathexp.c
	- make sure to free `newnames' (but *not* its contents) before
	  returning from ignore_globbed_names

builtins/exec.def
	- make sure the argv created to pass to shell_execve is freed if
	  the execve fails and we're not exiting on failed execs

expr.c
	- broke evalexp into two functions: evalexp, which sets up the
	  jmp_buf that errors jump to, and subexpr, which does the
	  evaluation and pushing and popping of contexts
	- readtok now calls subexpr to evaluate subexpressions in
	  parentheses
	- evalexp now takes an additional paramter, a pointer to an int.
	  If the expression contains errors, the location to which this
	  points gets 0, otherwise it gets 1 to show that the value
	  returned may be used.  This plugs up memory leaks that were
	  the result of evalexp() longjmping back to top_level
	- fixed a memory leak: expr_stack[0] was not being freed

externs.h
	- changed extern declaration for evalexp

variables.c, subst.c, builtins/let.def
	- changed calls to evalexp appropriately.  They either cause a
	  longjmp (top_level, DISCARD) (which is what the old stuff in
	  expr.c did) or are handled by returning an appropriate error
	  value (e.g., &expand_word_error in subst.c)

				   4/16
				   ----
shell.c
	- make sure to free dollar_vars[0] before assigning it the first
	  argument following `-c command'

variables.c
	- if unsetting a local variable with a previous context, make sure	
	  to free the hash table element used to store the local variable

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- rearrange the includes so <sys/ioctl.h> is included before rltty.h,
	  as it is in rltty.c

				   4/17
				   ----
flags.c
	- new function: reset_shell_flags, which resets all of the flags
	  back to their initial values

flags.h
	- extern declaration for reset_shell_flags

builtins/set.def
	- new function: reset_shell_options, which resets all of the -o
	  options that are not also shell flags back to their initial values

builtins/shopt.def
	- new function: reset_shopt_options, which resets all of the shopt
	  options that are not also shell flags or -o options back to their
	  initial values

builtins/common.h
	- extern declarations for reset_shell_options and reset_shopt_options

execute_cmd.c
	- broke the code that reinitializes things when an executable script
	  without a leading `#!' is found out into a new function:
	  initialize_subshell
	- initialize_subshell now calls the reset_* functions that reset the
	  shell flags and options

general.c, general.h
	- move_to_high_fd now takes a third argument: the highest fd at which
	  to start looking.  If that's less than 20, the maximum number of
	  open files as returned by getdtablesize() is used (which is what
	  it did before this)

jobs.c, shell.c, subst.c
	- changed calls to move_to_high_fd appropriately

[bash-2.01-beta1 frozen]

general.c
	- itos now uses a local char buffer to do its conversion, but still
	  returns newly-allocated memory

				   4/21
				   ----
variables.c
	- be a little more careful when checking for backwards-compatibility
	  with exported function definitions

				   4/22
				   ----
builtins/ulimit.def
	- translate RLIM_INFINITY to limit.rlim_max if the current limit is
	  less than or equal to the hard limit, not just strictly less than
	  (the change of 3/28 was too drastic)

				   4/23
				   ----
oslib.c
	- fixed definition of to_lower on machines without strcasecmp

trap.c
	- don't free the trap command in change_signal if the SIG_INPROGRESS
	  is set in the signal's flags -- it will cause memory to be freed
	  twice if a trap command resets the signal handler more than once,
	  and _run_trap_internal keeps a pointer to the trap command so it
	  can free it, so there will be no leaks

				   4/24
				   ----
aclocal.m4,configure.in
	- removed BASH_CC_WORKS, since AC_PROG_CC now has the functionality

shell.c, externs.h
	- get_current_user_info is now a void function

bashline.c
	- alias_expand_line_internal was removed
	- new function, alias_expand_line, performs alias expansion on
	  rl_line_buffer and either replaces rl_line_buffer or signals
	  an error
	- new bindable commands: alias-expand-line and
	  history-and-alias-expand-line, available if ALIAS is defined

				   4/25
				   ----
Makefile.in, lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- changed the define that turns on malloc range checking from
	  `rcheck' to `RCHECK'

lib/readline/isearch.c
	- fixed a couple of places where rl_search_history would try to
	  free a NULL pointer

				   4/29
				   ----
unwind_prot.c
	- fixed a problem with saving a variable that is a null pointer
	  in unwind_protect_var.  It happens only on machines where the
	  size of a pointer is not the size of an int.  The old FASTCOPY
	  code would copy the eight bytes at memory location zero, which
	  did not necessarily make a null pointer

				   4/30
				   ----
shell.c
	- run_startup_files should turn off job control, since the startup
	  files should be run without job control enabled -- this makes
	  SIGINT interrupt startup file execution again
	- if we get a SIGINT or other longjmp to top_level while executing
	  the startup files, re-enable job control for interactive shells
	  before setting locally_skip_execution

				    5/2
				    ---
lib/readline/nls.c
	- if we have setlocale(3), don't bother with checking the
	  environment variables for valid values; just use setlocale()
	  to set the locale categories from the environment variables
	  directly and go into eight-bit mode if the current locale is
	  not C or POSIX

				    5/5
				    ---
sig.c
	- make sure that the handler for SIGPROF is not changed if it has
	  been set to something other than SIG_IGN or SIG_DFL -- this makes
	  profiling work after the terminating signals have been initialized

bashline.c
	- if a filename containing `!' is completed, and the user has started
	  the string with a `"', change the completion style to backslash-	
	  quoting, since there's no way to use `!' with double quotes (this
	  requires more changes to readline to really work right)

				    5/6
				    ---
lib/readline/complete.c
	- changes to make_quoted_replacement, insert_all_matches, and
	  insert_match and their callers to allow the application-specific
	  filename quoting function to change the quote character (e.g., for
	  bash to change a filename containing a `!' and started with a
	  double quote by the user into a filename with the `!' quoted by
	  a backslas and no double quote)

				    5/8
				    ---
jobs.c
	- new function: nohup_all_jobs(), calls nohup_job for each entry in
	  the jobs list
	- delete_all_jobs is now global

jobs.h
	- new extern declarations for delete_all_jobs() and nohup_all_jobs()

builtins/jobs.def
	- `disown' without any jobspec arguments means the current job.  Fix
	  a core dump printing the error message when there is no current job

				   5/12
				   ----
subst.c
	- process an expansion like $((foo); bar) as a command substitution,
	  not as an arithmetic expansion.  An arithmetic expansion must have
	  a closing `))'

				   5/14
				   ----
builtins/evalstring.c
	- the third argument to parse_and_execute() is now a flags word.
	  The caller can control the value of `interactive' and whether
	  or not history is disabled while parse_and_execute() runs

builtins/common.h
	- new #defines for the flag values for parse_and_execute()

{bashline,jobs,shell,subst,trap,variables}.c, parse.y, builtins/evalfile.c,
builtins/{eval,fc}.def
	- changed calls to parse_and_execute appropriately

builtins/evalfile.c
	- if _evalfile() is passed FEVAL_HISTORY as part of the flags arg,
	  don't pass SEVAL_NOHIST to parse_and_execute
	- new function: fc_execute_file, which sets FEVAL_HISTORY in the
	  flags argument to _evalfile()

bashline.c
	- call bash_add_history instead of add_history from
	  vi_edit_and_execute_command so the bash state variables get
	  updated properly.  This keeps the `v' command from operating
	  on an empty command when the history list is stifled

bashhist.c
	- bash_add_history is now global

bashhist.h
	- extern declaration for bash_add_history

builtins/fc.def
	- call fc_execute_file instead of maybe_execute_file in the
	  edit-and-re-execute case (fc -e ...)
	- don't manually insert the commands from the file created by `fc -e'
	  into the history list, just set remember_on_history and let
	  fc_execute_file take care of telling parse_and_execute to do the
	  right thing.  This makes compound commands and the `cmdhist'
	  and `lithist' settings work better.  This supersedes the fix of
	  1/27.  This was reported again by rchen@fractal.eng.yale.edu.

parse.y
	- the body of a `for' command (the commands between do...done or
	  {...}) should be a `compound_list' instead of a `list'.  Problem
	  reported by cpg@research.bell-labs.com

				   5/19
				   ----
lib/readline/complete.c
	- in filename_completion_function, if we find that the directory
	  pointer (return value from opendir(3)), is not null when state
	  is 0 (indicating that this is the first time the completion
	  function has been called for the current completion), call
	  closedir on it, assuming that it was left open by a previous
	  (interrupted) completion

	  English

tests/run-func
	- add a warning about exported functions in the environment

builtins/hash.def
	- if one of the arguments passed to `hash' is an absolute pathname,
	  just continue the loop, don't do list=list->next first.  This
	  fixes the `hash a/b' -> core dump bug

				   5/30

bashline.c
	- fixed a memory leak in command_word_completion_function, courtesy
	  of a.pfaller@pop.gun.de

hashcmd.c
	- fixed find_hashed_filename to always return a newly-allocated
	  string

execute_cmd.c
	- since find_hashed_filename returns newly-allocated memory, don't
	  call savestring() on it, and free it if the data is stale (in
	  search_for_command()).  Another memory leak fixed courtesy of
	  a.pfaller@pop.gun.de

lib/readline/histfile.c
	- open the history file for writing with mode 0600 for better

	  [in bash-2.01.1]

execute_cmd.c
	- select_query now uses legal_number to decide whether the user's

	  invalid input is entered
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

builtins/evalstring.c
	- fix to parse_and_execute so `bash -c 'time [-p] zzz'' works right

execute_cmd.c
	- fix to execute_command_internal so that `bash -c time [-p] (zzz)''

	  [in bash-2.01.1]
	- print_formatted_time should pass a long as the fourth parameter
	  to mkfmt 
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

externs.h, shell.c
	- `exit_shell' is now a void function

hashlib.c
	- print_table_stats is now a void function

mailcheck.c
	- made add_mail_file check for the filename in the mail file list
	  using the expanded filename, since that is what it puts into
	  the list
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

variables.c
	- for the time being, PWD will be auto-exported, since some systems
	  seem to expect it

doc/bashref.texi, lib/readline/doc/{hist,rlman}.texinfo
	- added necessary `dircategory' and `direntry' commands to make
	  `install-info' work correctly

Makefile.in
	- move $(LDFLAGS) after $(BUILTINS_LDFLAGS) and $(LIBRARY_LDFLAGS) on
	  the line that links bash

doc/texinfo.tex
	- upgraded to version 2.185 from the texinfo-3.9 distribution

lib/tilde/tilde.c
	- fixed a bug in tilde_expand so that enough space is allocated for
	  the string and terminating null byte if a `~' does not appear.
	  This was masked before by the bash malloc()
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

aclocal.m4
	- new test, BASH_TYPE_INT32_T, to check which builtin C type is
	  32 bits wide
	- new test, BASH_TYPE_PTRDIFF_T, to check which builtin C type is
	  appropriate for pointer arithmetic

configure.in
	- check sizes of int and long, and for the existence of an int32_t
	  basic system type.  Call BASH_TYPE_INT32_T if int32_t is not
	  defined anywhere in the system header files
	- check size of (char *), and for the existence of a ptrdiff_t
	  basic system type.  Call BASH_TYPE_PTRDIFF_T if ptrdiff_t is not
	  defined anywhere in the system header files
	- added a check for <stddef.h>

config.h.in
	- add lines for SIZEOF_INT, SIZEOF_LONG, SIZEOF_CHAR_P, int32_t,
	  u_int32_t, and ptrdiff_t
	- added line for HAVE_STDDEF_H

lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- new version, with many changes and much better memory usage; old
	  (bash-2.01) version is lib/malloc/omalloc.c

lib/malloc/gmalloc.c
	- new version, with a number of changes and range checking included
	  by default; old (bash-2.01) version is lib/malloc/ogmalloc.c

execute_cmd.c
	- applied patch from 5/27 to make execute_simple_command fork early
	  if it's part of a pipeline.  This keeps assignment statements or
	  other commands that don't require a builtin, function, or disk
	  command to be executed from modifying the shell's environment

tests/exec?.sub
	- renamed from tests/execscript.sub? because those filenames are
	  too long for System V 14-char filename systems

	  collating symbols, equivalence classes), full support for
	  strcoll(3), and case-insensitive pattern matching

lib/glob/fnmatch.h
	- new version, with necessary symbols for the new fnmatch.c

tests/posixpat.{tests,right}, tests/run-posixpat
	- test suite for the POSIX.2 BRE pattern matching code

variables.c
	- make sure that array assignment using the compound syntax empties
	  the array before doing the assignment
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

trap.c
	- new function, trap_to_sighandler(sig), which returns the correct
	  trap handler for SIG depending on the information in sigmodes[sig]
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

sig.h
	- extern declarations for trap_handler and trap_to_sighandler
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

jobs.c
	- if we get an interrupt while waiting for a command to complete,
	  and there was a trap set on SIGINT that resets the handler to
	  SIG_DFL, the value that waitchld uses for old_trap_handler will
	  be wrong (it will be trap_handler, but trap_handler no longer
	  knows anything about SIGINT).  If old_signal_handler is trap_handler,
	  but signal_is_trapped(SIGINT) returns 0, we need to call
	  trap_to_sighandler to decide what to do

builtins/type.def
	- removed mention of `-type', `-path', and `-all' options from the
	  long help description

error.c, error.h
	- new function: internal_warning, for warning messages

variables.c
	- changed a call to internal_error to use internal_warning
	- modified change of 7/3 so that arrays are not emptied until
	  just before the shell is about to assign the new values, so
	  the old value can be used to generate the rhs of the assignment,
	  if necessary.  This is how `normal' shell variables work
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

jobs.c, jobs.h
	- delete_job now takes a second int argument and prints a warning
	  message when deleting a stopped job if the second argument is
	  non-zero

jobs.c, builtins/jobs.def
	- changed all calls to delete_job to provide a proper second arg

lib/readline/bind.c
	- broke rl_read_init_file into an `upper' and `lower' half in
	  preparation for adding file inclusion capability to inputrc
	  parsing
	- handle_parser_directive now displays an error message if an
	  unknown directive is encountered
	- parser_endif now prints an error message if an $endif without

	- added `$include' parser directive to read bindings and commands
	  from another file at that point

lib/readline/doc/rluser.texinfo, doc/{bash.{1,html},readline.3}
	- documented new readline `$include' parser directive

	  for CYGWIN32 users

lib/readline/kill.c
	- incorporated bfox's patches for `iterative' yank-last-arg handling.
	  This means that one can keep pressing M-. and move backwards in
	  the history, yanking the last argument of successive history lines

lib/readline/rlwinsize.h
	- new file, encapsulates various locations of the definition for
	  `struct winsize'

aclocal.m4
	- augmented BASH_STRUCT_WINSIZE to look in termios.h as well as

support/config.guess
	- add better support for SunOS on M68K (old Sun3 machines)

parse.y
	- check for compound array assignment in read_token_word only if

jobs.c, jobs.h
	- nohup_all_jobs and delete_all_jobs now take a parameter which

jobs.c
	- changed all calls to delete_all_jobs

builtins/jobs.def
	- added `-a' (all jobs) and `-r' (running jobs only) options to

builtins/Makefile.in
	- PROFILE_FLAGS is now substituted into the Makefile by configure

configure.in
	- new options, --enable-profiling and --enable-static-link, to turn

	  for use as a root shell.  The former implies the latter.  If
	  we're linking statically, dynamic loading of new builtins is not

	  [in bash-2.01.1]

lib/readline/{complete,bind}.c
	- new readline variable, print-completions-horizontally, which causes
	  matches to be printed across the screen (like `ls -x') rather than
	  up-and-down (like `ls')
	- new readline variable, completion-ignore-case, which causes filename

	- bumped the version number up to 2.02-alpha1

bracecomp.c
	- fixes so that the braces are not quoted by the filename quoting
	  function when complete-into-braces is executed with M-{.  The
	  brace completion functions do filename quoting themselves
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

pathexp.c

subst.c,execute_cmd.c
	- changed calls to quote_string_for_globbing to pass the correct
	  flag arguments

expr.c
	- added a `**' binary operator to do exponentiation (2**16 == 65536).
	  precedence is lower than arithmetic operators, higher than unary

	  exits with a status of 125 if one is attempted.  If there is an
	  expansion error, the shell exits with a status of 127.  If there
	  is a shell parsing error, the shell exits with a status of 126.
	  Otherwise, the exit status is 0.  The current output is

		number of words\n
		number of bytes\n
		expanded words, one per line, separated by newlines

	  This will have to be changed when an interface to glibc is coded

hashcmd.h
	- reduced the default size of the filename hash table from 631
	  to 107

sig.c
	- don't call initialize_siglist if HAVE_UNDER_SYS_SIGLIST is defined
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

siglist.c
	- don't compile this file if HAVE_UNDER_SYS_SIGLIST is defined
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

variables.c
	- fix to make $RANDOM work better in subshells
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

aclocal.m4
	- new macro, BASH_DECL_UNDER_SYS_SIGLIST, looks for _sys_siglist in
	  <signal.h> and <unistd.h>, defines UNDER_SYS_SIGLIST_DECLARED if
	  found
	  [in bash-2.01.1]
	- change BASH_UNDER_SYS_SIGLIST to require BASH_DECL_UNDER_SYS_SIGLIST,
	  like BASH_SYS_SIGLIST requires AC_DECL_SYS_SIGLIST
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

config.h.in
	- add a line for UNDER_SYS_SIGLIST_DECLARED
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

configure.in
	- make sure that SVR4_2 is defined for machines that have $host_os
	  sysv4.2* (e.g., sysv4.2MP) as well as $host == sysv4.2
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

				   7/29
				   ----
command.h
	- new command type, ARITH_COM, used to create and execute a ((...))
	  command without translating it into let "..."

parse.y
	- changes to the grammar and lexer so that ((...)) is parsed as a
	  command of type ARITH_CMD.  An ARITH_CMD is a WORD_LIST, for
	  future expansion, even though only the first word is used

make_cmd.c, make_cmd.h
	- definition and declaration of a function to build an arithmetic
	  command

dispose_cmd.c
	- added code to dispose of arithmetic commands

print_cmd.c
	- added code to print arithmetic commands, both `regularly' and
	  when they're being traced with `set -x'

externs.h
	- extern declaration for xtrace_print_arith_cmd

copy_cmd.c
	- added code to copy arithmetic commands

execute_cmd.c
	- added code to directly execute arithmetic commands -- they are
	  a shell_control_structure, so just about everything like
	  redirections and piping is taken care of by the boilerplate code.
	  All that's needed is to expand the expression (which is within
	  double quotes -- added by parse.y:parse_arith_cmd()), print it
	  if tracing is enabled, call the expression evaluator, and return
	  an appropriate result

				   7/30
				   ----
input.c
	- new function, set_buffered_stream(fd, bp), sets the buffered stream
	  associated with FD to BP and returns the old buffered stream

input.h
	- extern declaration for set_buffered_stream

parse.y
	- call set_buffered_stream rather than manipulating the BUFFERS array
	  directly

shell.c
	- unset_bash_input now takes an argument, CHECK_ZERO.  This tells it
	  whether to check whether default_buffered_input is >= 0 or just > 0

externs.h
	- changed extern declaration for unset_bash_input

execute_cmd.c, jobs.c, nojobs.c
	- changed calls to unset_bash_input to add appropriate argument

input.h
	- #undef B_* before defining them as flag values for b_flags.  Some
	  systems, like SVR4, have a B_ERROR define in a file included by
	  jobs.c and nojobs.c, and it causes a warning

				   7/31
				   ----
fnmatch.c
	- rewrote most of fnmatch(), so that it now implements ksh-88 style
	  pattern matching (`[@+*?!](patlist)') if the FNM_EXTMATCH flag
	  is set

fnmatch.h
	- added a define for FNM_EXTMATCH

				    8/4
				    ---
lib/readline/display.c
	- fixed _rl_redisplay_after_sigwinch () so that it really redisplays
	  only the portion after the final newline of a multi-line prompt
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

bashline.c
	- attempt_shell_completion no longer returns matches if a glob pattern
	  matches more than one filename -- it caused too many problems
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

				    8/5
				    ---
lib/glob/glob.c
	- updated glob_pattern_p so that the extended matching operators
	  are recognized

pathexp.c
	- udpated unquoted_glob_pattern_p so that the extended matching
	  operators are recognized
	- udpated quote_globbing_chars so that the extended matching
	  operators are recognized and quoted appropriately

subst.c
	- updated match_pattern_char so that the extended matching operators
	  are recognized

parse.y
	- updated read_token_word so that it parses an extended matching
	  pattern as a single word

jobs.c
	- if a job is suspended with SIGTSTP, and the user has set
	  checkwinsize with `shopt', update the window size
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

pathexp.c, pathexp.h
	- new global variable, extended_glob, controls whether the extended
	  pattern matching features are enabled

pathexp.h
	- new define, FNMATCH_EXTFLAG, to be OR'd with other values for
	  flags argument to fnmatch to enable the extended pattern matching
	  features if extended_glob is set

{pathexp,execute_cmd,bashhist,subst,test}.c, builtins/help.def
	- changed calls to fnmatch to add FNMATCH_EXTFLAG to the flags arg if
	  extended_glob is non-zero

lib/glob/glob.c
	- changed flags arg passed to fnmatch to include FNM_EXTMATCH if
	  extended_glob is non-zero (#ifdef SHELL)

				    8/6
				    ---
builtins/shopt.def
	- added a new `extglob' shell option, controls the value of
	  extended_glob

				    8/7
				    ---
doc/{bash.{1,html},bashref.texi}
	- documented new extended pattern matching operators and the `extglob'
	  shell option

tests/{extglob.{tests,right},run-extglob}
	- test suite for the new extended globbing features

				    8/8
				    ---
parse.y, pathexp.h, lib/glob/fnmatch.c
	- made the extended globbing code #ifdef EXTENDED_GLOB

config.h.in
	- added a line for EXTENDED_GLOB, controlled by configure

configure.in
	- new option, --enable-extended-glob, controls defining of
	  EXTENDED_GLOB (on by default)

doc/bashref.texi
	- documented new `configure' `--enable-extended-glob' option

				   8/11
				   ----
builtins/printf.def
	- new `printf' builtin, implemented according to POSIX.2 spec
	  for printf(1)

Makefile.in,builtins/Makefile.in
	- added necessary stuff for new printf builtin

				   8/12
				   ----
lib/readline/isearch.c
	- change to make ^G interrupt the incremental search correctly
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

configure.in, config.h.in
	- configure now checks for the availability of strtoul(3)

builtins/printf.def
	- use strtoul for the `%o', `%u', `%x', and `%X' formats if it
	  is available

				   8/13
				   ----
tests/{printf.{right,tests},run-printf}
	- extensive test suite for the new `printf' builtin

builtins/Makefile.in
	- change so that `builtext.h' is not recreated every time the source
	  file for a builtin is changed if the contents are the same.  This
	  keeps many files from being recompiled

				   8/14
				   ----
subst.c
	- changed verify_substring_values so that it returns -1 for substring
	  range errors, 0 for expression errors, and 1 for success
	  [in bash-2.01.1]
	- changed parameter_brace_substring to return an error if
	  verify_substring_values returns 0, and a null string if it returns
	  -1.  This matches the ksh93 behavior
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

trap.c
	- changed decode_signal so that it makes sure the first three
	  characters of a signal name are `SIG' before allowing the `SIG'
	  prefix to be omitted.  This is so a signal spec of `T' does not
	  match `EXIT', for instance
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

builtins/trap.def
	- make sure that showtrap() displays traps for signals with unknown
	  names using the signal number
	  [in bash-2.01.1]
shell.c
	- make sure that `bash -r' doesn't turn on the restricted mode until
	  after the startup files are executed
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

doc/{bash.{1,html},bashref.texi}
	- documented printf builtin

				   8/15
				   ----
general.c
	- added \xNNN escape to ansicstr -- NNN are up to three hex digits.
	  This affects $'...', `echo -e', and printf

builtins/printf.def
	- added \xNNN escape to bexpand -- NNN are up to three hex digits.
	  This affects printf's `%b' conversion specifier

doc/{bash.{1,html},bashref.texi}
	- documented new \xNNN escape sequence for echo, $'...', and printf

builtins/setattr.def
	- make sure that a variable found in the temp environment does not
	  cause a null string to be assigned by bind_variable (e.g.,
		foo="" export foo
	  )
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

				   8/18
				   ----
subst.c
	- fixed a bug that sometimes caused bad memory (pointer into an
	  allocated block) to be passed to free when doing arithmetic
	  substitution.  Bug report from stevet@myofb.org
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

				   8/19
				   ----
subst.c
	- considerable changes:  moved the code that expands a single
	  $... parameter expansion into a separate function: param_expand()
	  This function returns a string, which may contain characters
	  quoted with CTLESC or CTLNUL without doing word splitting
	- changed expand_word_internal to not remove the expansion of "$*"
	  if the number of positional parameters is > 0
	- changed the '"' case of expand_word_internal to remove quoted
	  nulls from the resultant word if the expansion was not "$@", and
	  the word is not a quoted null string ([] == CTLNUL, [1] == '\0')

subst.c, variables.c
	- moved the code that handles special variables from subst.c to
	  variables.c

				   8/20
				   ----
subst.c
	- rearranged the source a bit to group functions with similar
	  operation together
	- fixed parameter_brace_expand so that it no longer allows
	  indirect expansion of `special' variables
	- fixed parameter_brace_expand so taking the length of some of
	  the shell's special parameters works again
	- moved all of the code that computes the length of a shell
	  parameter (the ${#xxx} expansion) into parameter_brace_expand_length.
	  Previously, the code that handled the lengths of the shell's
	  special parameters was in parameter_brace_expand_word
	- valid indirect expansions are now only variable names or positional
	  parameters

				   8/21
				   ----
subst.c
	- fixed param_expand to raise an expansion error if $! is being
	  expanded and no asynchronous processes have been created
	- an expression error in a $((...)) arithmetic expansion now causes
	  a non-interactive shell running in POSIX mode to exit
	- relaxed change of 8/20 to allow indirect references to $#, $@, $*

builtins/bashref.texi
	- documented new posix-mode exit on invalid expressions in $((...))

lib/readline/complete.c
	- don't call rl_strpbrk unless rl_filename_quote_characters is not
	  NULL -- strpbrk requires non-NULL arguments
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

				   8/22
				   ----
bashline.c
	- don't make `history-expand-line' a bindable command unless
	  BANG_HISTORY is defined, and don't compile the code for that
	  command in unless BANG_HISTORY is defined
	- make history_expand_line(), tcsh_magic_space(), alias_expand_line(),
	  and history_and_alias_expand_line() int-returning functions that
	  return 0 for success and non-zero on error.  This allows
	  tcsh_magic_space() to just call history_expand_line() and insert
	  a space if that returns successfully
	- `magic-space' is now a bindable readline command

doc/bash.{1,html}, lib/readline/doc/rluser.texinfo
	- documented new `magic-space' bindable readline command

				   8/25
				   ----
parse.y
	- fixed decode_prompt_string so that values of $PWD longer than
	  PATH_MAX don't cause buffer overruns (char t_string[PATH_MAX])
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

general.c
	- fixed polite_directory_format so that values of $HOME longer
	  than PATH_MAX don't cause buffer overruns (char tdir[PATH_MAX])
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

subst.c
	- fix to expansion of $* so that the positional parameters are
	  separated by the first character of $IFS, even when the expansion
	  is not within double quotes, so the correct split is still
	  performed even when IFS does not contain a space.  Works for
	  ${*}, too
	- fix to expansion of $@ so that the positional parameters are
	  separated by the first character of $IFS, even when the expansion
	  is not within double quotes, so the correct split is still
	  performed even when IFS does not contain a space.  Works for
	  ${@}, too
	- new function, string_list_dollar_at(), which is to $@ as
	  string_list_dollar_star is to $*
	- fixed expansion of $@ so that splitting is still done even if
	  IFS is unset or NULL, as POSIX.2 specifies (section 3.5.2)
	- fixed expansion of $* so that it expands to multiple words if there
	  is more than one positional parameter, just like $@, even if
	  IFS is unset or NULL
	- new function list_quote_escapes, quotes (with CTLESC) all
	  CTLESC and CTLNUL characters in each member of the list

tests/dollar-{at,star}.sh
	- combined into dollar-at-star, changed run-dollars accordingly

				   8/26
				   ----
Makefile.in
	- make the `tests' target use $(SHELL) instead of hardcoding `sh'

				   8/29
				   ----
subst.c
	- expand_word_list_internal now takes a flags word as the second
	  argument, telling which expansions to perform on the WORD_LIST
	- broke expand_word_list_internal into several functions: one
	  each to do brace expansion, glob expansion, and the `normal'
	  shell expansions
	- new extern function: expand_words_shellexp() to perform the
	  `normal' shell expansions on a WORD_LIST

subst.h
	- extern declaration for expand_words_shellexp

bashline.c
	- fixed a problem with attempt_shell_completion where it attempted
	  to refer to rl_line_buffer[-1] (completion at the start of the
	  line, which means that ti == -1, which means that the test for
	  rl_line_buffer[ti] at line 715 was an array bounds error
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

eval.c
	- new function, parse_string_to_word_list(), which takes a string
	  and runs it through the parser, returning the resultant word
	  list

externs.h
	- new extern declaration for parse_string_to_word_list()

variables.c
	- change assign_array_var_from_string to first split the string
	  between the parens on whitespace, then expand the resultant
	  list of words with all the shell expansions before doing the
	  assignment

				    9/4
				    ---
redir.c, redir.h
	- redirection_error is no longer a static function

builtins/evalstring.c
	- changes to handle $( < filename ) (equivalent to $(cat filename))
	  as in ksh

lib/readline/bind.c
	- added two new functions: rl_unbind_function_in_map(func, map),
	  which unbinds all keys that execute FUNC in MAP; and
	  rl_unbind_command_in_map(command, map), which unbinds all keys
	  bound to COMMAND in MAP

lib/readline/readline.h
	- extern declarations for rl_unbind_{function,command}_in_map

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texi
	- documented rl_unbind_{function,command}_in_map

builtins/bind.def
	- added a new option, -u FUNCNAME, which unbinds all key sequences
	  bound to FUNCNAME in the specified (or current) keymap

doc/{bash.{1,html},bashref.texi}
	- documented new $( < filename ) command substitution
	- documented new bind -u FUNCNAME option

				    9/5
				    ---
shell.c
	- send SIGHUP to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits if
	  the variable `hup_on_exit' is non-zero
	- modified run_startup_files so that if `NON_INTERACTIVE_LOGIN_SHELLS'
	  is #define'd (perhaps in config.h.top, though there is nothing there
	  for it), all login shells (interactive and non-interactive) run
	  /etc/profile and one of the per-user login shell startup files

builtins/shopt.def
	- new shopt option `huponexit' to control the value of hup_on_exit

doc/{bash.{1,html},bashref.texi}
	- documented new `huponexit' shell option

				    9/8
				    ---
builtins/common.c
	- changed contains_shell_metas to return 1 if a tilde appears at the
	  start of a string or after a `=' or `:'
	- changed backslash_quote to quote a tilde if it appears at the start
	  of a string or after a `=' or `:'

lib/readline/complete.c
	- moved rl_tilde_expand to util.c; it doesn't really have anything
	  to do with completion
	- moved insert_text to readline.c, renamed it _rl_replace_text (since
	  that's really what it does), changed callers
	- moved code that postprocesses the list of completion matches into
	  a new function: postprocess_matches
	- new implementation of tcsh-like menu completion in a single new
	  function: rl_menu_complete

lib/readline/{funmap.c,readline.h}
	- necessary declarations for binding rl_menu_complete to the
	  new `menu-complete' command

doc/{bash.{1,html},readline.3}, lib/readline/doc/rluser.texinfo
	- documented new `menu-complete' bindable readline command

				    9/9
				    ---
jobs.c
	- delete_job should print a warning only if subshell_environment
	  is 0, so we don't print bogus warnings when shell scripts without
	  a leading #! are executed

				   9/10
				   ----
builtins/read.def
	- fixed the code so that the `read' is automatically restarted when
	  it returns -1 with errno == EINTR.  SIGINT is handled by the
	  interrupt handler, since interrupt_immediately is set to 1, so
	  this handles things like SIGCHLD
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

				   9/11
				   ----
test.c
	- reorganized the code slightly to make it easier to add the ksh-like
	  [[...]] compound command

test.h
	- new file, with extern declarations for functions available in test.c

externs.h
	- moved declaration of test_command to test.h

builtins/test.def
	- include `test.h'

				   9/16
				   ----
{command,make_cmd,dispose_cmd,externs,subst}.h
parse.y, subst.c
{make,dispose,copy,print,execute}_cmd.c
	- changes to add the new ksh-93 compatible [[...]] conditional command

configure.in
	- new enable option, --enable-cond-command, to compile in the [[...]]
	  command code

config.h.in
	- new #define, COND_COMMAND, to compile in the [[...]] command code

tests/{run-cond,cond.{tests,right}}
	- test suite for the new [[...]] command

{builtins,lib/{readline,glob,tilde}}/Makefile.in
	- explicit dependencies for .o files on .c files for losing makes
	  like Solaris

doc/{bash.{1,html},bashref.texi}
	- documented the new `[[' compound command
	- documented the test/[ builtin behavior based on the number of
	  arguments in the description of the builtin
	- made a new section for conditional expressions that just lists
	  the available primaries -- the connectives and other operators
	  are listed in the description of the [[ command and the test/[
	  builtin

				   9/18
				   ----
builtins/set.def
	- minus_o_option_commands is now a global function so the shopt
	  code can use it
	- minus_o_option_commands now takes an argument telling it which
	  options to print, just like list_minus_o_options
	- new function, print_minus_o_option, which prints the value of
	  a `set -o' option either in the traditional format or in the
	  format used by `set +o'
	- changed list_minus_o_opts and minus_o_option_commands to call
	  print_minus_o_option

builtins/shopt.def
	- `shopt -p' now causes output to be printed in a format reusable
	  as input (the format is a series of shopt commands, like the
	  output of `set +o')
	- fixed a bug that made `shopt -so' and `shopt -uo' not work
	- fixed list_shopt_o_options so that `shopt -op' acts like `set +o'
	- fixed list_shopt_o_options to that `shopt -op optname' prints the
	  value of optname in a reusable format
	- fixed list_some_o_options so that `shopt -ops' and `shopt -opu'
	  work and display output in a reusable format

				   9/19
				   ----
doc/{bash.{1,html},bashref.texi}
	- documented new `shopt -p' behavior

shell.c
	- made `bash +o' display the same output as `set +o' and then
	  start an interactive shell (previously `bash -o' and `bash +o'
	  displayed the same thing)

builtins/common.h
	- added prototypes to the extern function declarations

				   9/22
				   ----
builtins/evalstring.c
	- fixed the DISCARD case of the jump_to_top_level so that it
	  doesn't try to call dispose_command(command) after the
	  `pe_dispose' unwind frame gets run, since that disposes the
	  command

				   9/23
				   ----
test.[ch]
	- test_eaccess is now a global function so that globbing code can
	  use it

lib/glob/glob.c
	- rewrote glob_vector to be slightly more efficient and to not
	  read the directory if the filename pattern does not contain
	  any globbing chars.  This satisfies the POSIX requirement that
	  read permission is not required for a directory when the
	  pathname component does not contain a pattern character (bug
	  reported by jsm28@cam.ac.uk)

subst.c
	- fixed parameter_brace_expand so that ${array[@]} and ${array[*]}
	  behave correctly when IFS is unset or set to something that does
	  not contain a space (they should result in separate words, just
	  like $@ and $*)

tests/{run-array2,array-at-star,array2.right}
	- tests for the expansions of ${array[@]} and ${array[*]}, derived
	  from the tests in dollar-at-star

				   9/24
				   ----
jobs.c
	- fixed cleanup_dead_jobs so that it doesn't remove the job
	  containing last_asynchronous_pid from the job table.  This
	  fixes the POSIX.2 `wait' requirement problem

				   9/25
				   ----
parse.y
	- added `\r' escape sequence to the prompt expansion code

lib/readline/chardefs.h
	- added defines for ISOCTAL, OCTVALUE, isxdigit (if not defined),
	  and HEXVALUE

lib/readline/bind.c
	- added `normal' echo/printf-like backslash escapes to the
	  key sequence translation code, with the addition that \d
	  expands to RUBOUT.  This means that key sequence definitions
	  (before the `:') and macro values may contain these special
	  backslash-escape sequences
	- now that we can translate octal escape sequences in key bindings,
	  change _rl_get_keyname so that it turns characters with values
	  128-159 inclusive into octal escape sequences (\200-\237), since
	  those characters are not ASCII or ISO Latin 1

doc/{bash.{1,html},readline.3}, lib/readline/doc/rluser.texinfo
	- documented new backslash escapes for readline key sequence and
	  macro translation

builtins/pushd.def
	- new function, get_dirstack_from_string(char *string), returns an
	  element from the directory stack or null, treating the argument
	  exactly as `dirs string' would, with the exception that if
	  the first character of `string' is not `+' or `-', a `+' is
	  assumed

builtins/common.h
	- new extern declaration for get_dirstack_from_string

general.c
	- added code to bash_special_tilde_expansions to get the expansion
	  using get_dirstack_from_string() if the first character of the
	  tilde-prefix is a digit or the first character is a `+' or `-'
	  and the second is a digit

tests/dstack.{tests,right}
	- renamed from dirstack.{tests,right}

tests/dtack2.{tests,right}
	- new tests for the directory stack tilde expansion code

tests/run-dirstack
	- now runs both dstack and dstack2

				   10/3
				   ----
trap.c
	- reordered header file inclusion for irix 4

execute_cmd.c
	- fixed select_query so that a reply that is not a number is treated
	  the same as a numeric reply that is out of range

lib/readline/util.c
	- added a backwards-compatibility definition of _rl_savestring()

builtins/set.def
	- initialize_shell_options now takes an argument saying whether or
	  not we should parse $SHELLOPTS from the environment.  The shell
	  does not parse the value if it's restricted, running setuid, or
	  running in `privileged mode'

shell.c
	- change call to initialize_shell_options to add the correct argument

builtins/common.h
	- changed extern declaration for initialize_shell_options

doc/{bash.{1,html},bashref.texi}
	- added note that the shell ignores $SHELLOPTS in the environment at
	  startup if running in privileged mode
	- added note that the restricted shell does not parse $SHELLOPTS from
	  the environment at startup

aclocal.m4
	- change BASH_RLIMIT_TYPE so that it looks for rlim_t in
	  <sys/resource.h> as well as <sys/types.h>, for Solaris 2.6
	- new macro, BASH_LARGE_FILE_SUPPORT, to enable special compilation
	  options for large files on Solaris 2.6 (from eggert@twinsun.com)

mailcheck.c
	- the `file_size' member of the FILEINFO struct should be of
	  type `off_t'
	- the `size' variable in file_has_grown should be of type `off_t'
	- the RESET_MAIL_FILE macro should initialize file_size to 0, not 0L

builtins/Makefile.in
	- LDFLAGS and LOCAL_LDFLAGS are now set by configure
	- `mkbuiltins' is now created from `mkbuiltins.o' instead of directly
	  from the source to the executable

builtins/evalfile.c
	- fixed _evalfile so that it handles large files correctly on
	  systems where the st_size member of `struct stat' will not fit
	  into an `int'

builtins/mkbuiltins.c
	- don't assume that st_size fits into an int

input.[ch]
	- the `b_size' member of a struct BSTREAM is now of type `size_t'
	- changed third argument to make_buffered_stream to size_t; changed
	  caller
	- changed `size' variable in fd_to_buffered_stream to type `size_t'

general.h
	- include <sys/resource.h> if HAVE_SYS_RESOURCE_H and RLIMTYPE are
	  both defined, for possible necessary definition of RLIMTYPE
	  (e.g., on Solaris 2.6)

{execute_cmd,jobs}.c, builtins/times.def
	- don't include <sys/resource.h> explicitly if RLIMTYPE is defined,
	  since general.h will include it in that case

lib/readline/bind.c
	- new function, char *_rl_read_file(filename, sizep), which reads
	  FILENAME into a malloced buffer, returning the buffer and the
	  size of the buffer in *SIZEP

lib/readline/histfile.c
	- changed read_history_range and history_truncate_file to handle
	  large files

hashcmd.c
	- find_hashed_filename should not add `./' to the front of a pathname
	  that already begins with `./'

				   10/8
				   ----
support/config.sub
	- recognize `hppa2.0' as a valid machine architecture

aclocal.m4
	- changed BASH_CHECK_LIB_TERMCAP so that `gnutermcap' is not chosen
	  if `$prefer_curses' is set to something

bashhist.c
	- don't use HISTCONTROL or HISTIGNORE to remove lines from the
	  second and subsequent lines of a multi-line command
	  (current_command_line_count > 1).  Old code did this only when
	  command-oriented-history was enabled

doc/{bash.{1,html},bashref.texi}
	- changed descriptions of HISTCONTROL and HISTIGNORE to state that
	  these variables are not applied to the second and subsequent
	  lines of a multi-line command

builtins/hash.def, {copy,dispose}_cmd.c
	- include "bashtypes.h" -- cray machines need it because of their
	  oddball definition of `word'

configure.in
	- changed check of ${host_cpu} to check for `*cray*' and `*Cray*'
	  when deciding whether to include the GNU malloc, since it
	  seems that ${host_cpu} gets set to `CrayYMP'

				   10/9
				   ----
configure.in
	- look for strtod and strtol in libc
	- make lib/sh directory in build directory if not there
	- create lib/sh/Makefile

config.h.in
	- added HAVE_STRTOD and HAVE_STRTOL

Makefile.in
	- changes for lib/sh/libsh.a (shell library)

builtins/printf.def
	- took out the `#ifdef STRTOUL' code, since strtoul is in libsh.a,
	  and will be resolved from there if it's not in libc

variables.c
	- call strtol() instead of string_to_long()

general.c, general.h
	- removed string_to_long
	- changed legal_number to use strtol so it correctly sets errno
	  to ERANGE on overflow
	- moved bash_getcwd_errstr here from lib/sh/oslib.c

externs.h
	- moved extern declarations for functions defined in libsh to a
	  separate section of the file, added extern declarations for
	  other functions in libsh

builtins/ulimit.def
	- changed macro definition for string_to_rlimtype to call strtol
	  directly instead of string_to_long

lib/sh/clktck.c
	- moved get_clock_tck to its own file, since it's compiled in
	  unconditionally

lib/sh/getenv.c
	- moved getenv() and __getenv() here from lib/sh/oslib.c

lib/sh/{setlinebuf,strerror,strcasecmp}.c
	- moved {setlinebuf,strerror,strcasecmp}() from oslib.c to
	  individual files

lib/sh/Makefile.in, Makefile.in
	- changes for new files in lib/sh

aclocal.m4
	- new macro BASH_SYS_RESTARTABLE_SYSCALLS, which does what
	  AC_SYS_RESTARTABLE_SYSCALLS does, but using posix sigaction()

configure.in
	- call BASH_SYS_RESTARTABLE_SYSCALLS if ac_cv_sys_restartable_syscalls
	  is `no'

builtins/jobs.def
	- catch out-of-range jobs better in disown_builtin

configure.in
	- don't build with GNU malloc on cygwin32

trap.c
	- change signal_name to handle the case where signal_names[sig] is
	  NULL, which can happen on cygwin32

execute_cmd.c
	- changes to do_piping to make pipes text mode (O_TEXT) on cygwin32

cross-build
	- new directory with cache files and other stuff for cross-compiling
	  bash (currently only for building for cygwin32 on a Unix machine)

cross-build/cygwin32.cache
	- new file containing configuration variable assignments for
	  cygwin32 that would otherwise require a default case for AC_TRY_RUN

configure.in
	- source ${srcdir}/cross-build/cygwin32.cache on CYGWIN32 systems
	  if we're cross-compiling on a unix machine
	- set $CC_FOR_BUILD for cygwin32 cross-compiling environment

Makefile.in
	- CC_FOR_BUILD is now a variable set by configure

builtins/mkbuiltins.c
	- only check for read(2) returning <= 0 in extract_info() (error
	  and exit on < 0, warning and return on == 0)

builtins/evalfile.c
	- only check for read(2) returning <= 0 in _evalfile() (error and
	  and failure return on < 0, success on == 0 while short-circuting
	  rest of operation)

				   10/14
				   -----

vprint.c
	- moved to lib/sh/vprint.c

lib/sh/Makefile.in
	- added entries for vprint.[co] in the appropriate places

cross-build/win32sig.h
	- a version of signames.h for cross-compiling for the CYGWIN32
	  environment on a Unix machine (from noer@cygnus.com)

aclocal.m4
	- made all cases of AC_TRY_RUN and AC_TRY_COMPILE have reasonable
	  default cases for cross-compiling, and tell the user what they are

Makefile.in
	- removed vprint.c from shell sources and vprint.o from shell
	  objects
	- added a level of indirection for signames.h -- the variable
	  SIGNAMES_H is set by configure to either `lsignames.h' or
	  a file for a cross-compilation environment (currently only
	  the cygwin32 stuff is supported).  Then that file is copied
	  to `signames.h'.  `lsignames.h' is created by `mksignames' as
	  was previously used to create signames.h directly

configure.in
	- set SIGNAMES_H to either `$(srcdir)/cross-build/win32sig.h' or
	  `lsignames.h' as appropriate, substitute into Makefile

				   10/15
				   -----
builtins/Makefile.in
	- CC_FOR_BUILD is now set by configure and used to build mkbuiltins
	  and psize.aux

variables.h
	- new variable attribute `att_tempvar', set if the SHELL_VAR * was
	  constructed on the fly from the temporary environment

variables.c
	- find_name_in_env_array now sets the `att_tempvar' attribute on
	  the SHELL_VAR it creates

findcmd.c
	- search_for_command now disposes the SHELL_VAR created by searching
	  the temporary environment for $PATH, if it is found there
	- _find_user_command_internal also disposes of the SHELL_VAR if it
	  has the `att_tempvar' attribute set

builtins/setattr.c
	- show_name_attributes looks in the temporary environemnt, so it needs
	  to dispose the SHELL_VAR if it has the att_tempvar attribute set

subst.c
	- parameter_brace_expand_word now disposes of the SHELL_VAR returned
	  by find_variable if it has the att_tempvar attribute set
	- ditto for param_expand and word_split

builtins/kill.def
	- disallow null pid arguments instead of treating them as 0
	- display a usage message and return failure if no pid or job
	  arguments are supplied

				   10/16
				   -----
builtins/declare.def
	- make `var=value declare -x var' behave the same as
	  `var=value export var' and `var=value declare -r var' behave the
	  same as `var=value readonly var', now that we have the `tempvar'
	  attribute

				   10/22
				   -----
jobs.c
	- non-interactive shells shouldn't report jobs killed by a SIGINT,
	  even if the standard output is to a terminal
	- pretty_print_job should add a CR at the end of its output if the
	  shell is interactive and asynchronous notification is being
	  performed.  This fixes the problem with extra CRs in the output
	  of $(jobs)

general.c
	- changed canonicalize_pathname to change `//' into `/', but leave
	  other pathnames starting with two consecutive slashes alone

				   10/27
				   -----

lib/readline/histexpand.c
	- fixed history_expand so that the appearance of the history
	  comment character at the beginning of a word inhibits history
	  expansion for the rest of the line

				   10/29
				   -----
jobs.c,variables.c
	- moved set_pipestatus_array to variables.c

variables.c
	- new function, set_pipestatus_from_exit(int), which sets the
	  PIPESTATUS variable from a command's exit status

variables.h
	- extern declarations for set_pipestatus_from_exit and
	  set_pipestatus_array

execute_cmd.c
	- fixed execute_simple_command to call set_pipestatus_from_exit
	  if a foreground builtin or function, or a foreground null
	  command is executed

				   10/31
				   -----
shell.c
	- fixed run_startup_files to detect being run by sshd, and treat
	  that case as equivalent to being run by rshd

				   11/3

builtins/set.def
	- make sure `set -a' doesn't cause SHELLOPTS to be exported when
	  a change is made to one of the shell options

pathexp.c
	- fix to shell_glob_filename in the code that uses a POSIX glob
	  library

				   11/5
				   ----
jobs.c
	- fix cleanup_dead_jobs to hang onto the job corresponding to
	  last_asynchronous_pid only if the shell is not interactive
	  (this still has the problem that until a new async process
	  is started, the job will stay in the jobs table)

configure.in,aclocal.m4
	- added a new macro, BASH_TYPE_U_INT32_T, to check for u_int32_t
	  separately from int32_t, since there are systems (HP-UX 10.20)
	  that have a define for the latter but not the former

				   11/6
				   ----
jobs.c
	- cleanup_dead_jobs no longer checks whether the job it is deleting
	  corresponds to last_asynchronous_pid
	- notify_of_job_status and mark_dead_jobs_as_notified now will not
	  mark the job corresponding to last_asynchronous_pid as notified
	  if the shell is not interactive
	- wait_for_single_pid, if told to wait for last_asynchronous_pid,
	  or the job of which it is a member, will take care of marking
	  the job as notified after calling wait_for and collecting the
	  status.  This means that two successive `wait' calls for $! will
	  succeed the first time and fail the second, as POSIX.2 specifies
	  (take this code out if it causes problems)

				   11/7
				   ----
jobs.c
	- wait_for_job, if told to wait for the job corresponding to the
	  last async pid, will mark the job as notified after waiting for
	  it and collecting the status

general.h
	- fixed MEMBER macro to avoid reading past end of S (it used to
	  test s[1] before s[0], which is an error if s == "")

subst.c
	- expand_word_internal should free ISTRING before returning if
	  param_expand returns an error
	- parameter_brace_expand_word should free the memory it allocates
	  and passes to param_expand

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_arith_command should call dispose_words on the list
	  returned by expand_words

parse.y
	- after calling parse_arith_command, read_token needs to free the
	  string value that parse_arith_command fills in, since make_word
	  makes a copy of the string it's passed

				   11/10
				   -----
subst.c
	- cond_expand_word needs to free the value returned by string_list
	  after it is run through quote_string_for_globbing

parse.y
	- make sure cond_term frees yylval.word if it is just a `!' and
	  it's parsed as a term negation operator

variables.c
	- assign_array_var_from_string needs to free the word list returned
	  by parse_string_to_word_list after calling expand_words_shellexp
	  on it

execute_cmd.c
	- changed execute_simple_command to avoid saving the_printed_command
	  into command_line until just before it's needed.  This should save
	  time and prevent memory leaks on errors, but it must be watched
	  closely to make sure that the_printed_command doesn't change out
	  from under execute_simple_command before we copy it

				   11/12
				   -----
builtins/alias.def
	- alias and unalias should print error messages when passed an
	  argument that is not an alias for printing or deletion,
	  respectively, even if the shell is not interactive

builtins/exit.def
	- `logout' will no longer exit a non-login non-interactive shell

				   11/17
				   -----
lib/readline/nls.c
	- add `koi8-r' as a legal LANG value

builtins/alias.def
	- if `alias' or `alias -p' is executed when no aliases are defined,
	  the return status should be 0, according to POSIX.2

				   11/18
				   -----
subst.c
	- changed a couple of calls to make_word_list (make_word(z), ...)
	  to add_string_to_list (z, ...)

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_cond_command now sets this_command_name to `[['

				   11/21
				   -----
variables.c
	- all_visible_{function,variable}s and the functions they call
	  should be compiled in only if READLINE is defined

aclocal.m4
	- remove some leading whitespace before preprocessor statements in
	  BASH_KERNEL_RLIMIT_CHECK

general.[ch]
	- fix declarations for group_member so the extern declaration in
	  general.h agrees with the definition in general.c (fix from
	  Andreas Schwab <schwab@issan.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>)

builtins/cd.def
	- print the new working directory if the shell is interactive
	  and `cd -' succeeds
	- don't print the new working directory if it's found in $CDPATH
	  if the shell is not interactive

				   11/25

support/config.guess
	- add support for new OS name for SINIX SVR4 systems

				   12/3
				   ----

builtins/set.def
	- `unset' should check that a function it's trying to unset is a
	  legal identifier only when in POSIX mode

redir.c
	- changed here_document_to_fd to try and make sure the filename
	  used for the here document is `more unique', since the old
	  version would fail if two here documents were created in less
	  than a second

				   12/4
				   ----
builtins/cd.def
	- POSIX.2 says that if CDPATH is used to find the new directory,
	  and it's not relative to the current directory, the new directory
	  name should be displayed on stdout even if the shell is not
	  interactive

				   12/5
				   ----
parse.y
	- changes so that `time' is recognized as a reserved word only at
	  the beginning of a pipeline (the last read token is one of 0,
	  `;', `\n', `&&', `||', or `&'):

		o add clause to special_case_tokens that does the check
		  and returns TIME if the conditions are met
		o take check for `TIME' out of CHECK_FOR_RESERVED_WORD, but
		  leave it in the word_token_alist so that `type' still
		  reports it as a `keyword'
		o new function, time_command_acceptable(), encapsulates the
		  necessary conditions for `time' to be returned as a 
		  reserved word

				   1/29
				   ----
parse.y
	- make sure the code for pushing and popping strings is compiled in
	  if either ALIAS or DPAREN_ARITHMETIC is defined, because the ((
	  code uses push_string in the case of a nested subshell
	- fix cond_skip_newlines so it resets the prompt to $PS2 while
	  parsing an unfinished conditional command

dispose_cmd.c, copy_cmd.c, builtins/hash.def
	- fixes to not use `word' as a variable name or the name of a
	  function parameter to get around stuff in the Cray Unix include
	  files

builtins/printf.def
	- return failure immediately if an illegal format character is
	  encountered

redir.c
	- make the code that creates here-documents behave better if the
	  file it's trying to create already exists for some reason

lib/readline/complete.c
	- changed print_filename to return the number of characters it
	  outputs; changed callers to use that value.  This makes columns
	  line up when printing completion listings with filenames
	  containing control characters

doc/bash.{1,html}
	- fixed a typo in the quote removal section

				   1/30
				   ----
parse.y
	- free_string_list() needs to check that t->expander is not NULL

	- reset_parser() doesn't need to set pushed_string_list to NULL
	  after calling free_string_list(), since free_string_list does it

configure.in,cross-build/cygwin32.cache
	- fixes from Geoff Noer for better cygwin32 cross-compilation

tests/printf.{tests,right}
	- removed test for integer overflow, since error messages differ
	  across systems

pathexp.c
	- fixed a problem with unquoted_glob_pattern_p that made things
	  like `x+*' not expand correctly

lib/glob/glob.c
	- fixed a problem with glob_pattern_p that made things like `x+*'
	  not expand correctly

builtins/cd.def
	- if `cd -P' is executed, or `set -o physical' has been executed,
	  the value of $PWD after a successful cd will not contain any

builtins/common.c
	- take out the code in backslash_quote() that looks for tildes to

	- if getcwd() fails, get_working_directory now prints the error
	  message corresponding to errno in addition to the rest of the
	  information -- TENTATIVE CHANGE

lib/sh/getcwd.c
	- fix from Paul Smith to make getcwd() behave better in the presence
	  of lstat(2) failures

stringlib.c
	- when copying the replacement string into the output string being
	  constructed, strsub() needs to make sure enough space for the
	  replacement string is allocated, not the length of the pattern
	  (use REPLEN, not PATLEN)

mailcheck.c
	- make sure make_default_mailpath() has a valid current_user struct
	  before trying to construct the default mailpath

				    2/5

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_builtin needs to call run_unwind_frame if the builtin is
	  `source' or `eval' and we're not in a subshell rather than just
	  calling dispose_builtin_env, because not all invocations copy 
	  the temporary_env to builtin_env, and nested calls to `.' require
	  that the temporary env given to the first persist until that first
	  call to `.' finishes

parse.y
	- fix to history_delimiting_chars so that function definitions like

		function xyz
		{
			echo a
		}

	  are saved to the history correctly when command_oriented_history
	  is enabled, but literal_history is not

bashhist.c
	- when calling internal_error from pre_process_line, use "%s" as
	  the format with history_value as the argument to avoid the
	  problem with the failed history event containing printf escape
	  sequences

shell.c

support/bashbug.sh
	- changed the bug-bash address to bug-bash@gnu.org

examples/loadables/Makefile.in
	- converted from `Makefile' with some boilerplate configure variables
	  to find the source and build directories -- still requires some
	  hand-editing to get the right CFLAGS and LDFLAGS for shared object
	  creation

Makefile.in
	- create examples/loadables/Makefile with `make makefiles'

configure.in
	- create examples/loadables directory so `make makefiles' can write a
	  makefile there

general.c
	- make sure initialize_groups_array always sets things up so that
	  ${GROUPS[0]} is the user's primary group (current_user.gid)

Makefile.in
	- make sure support/Makefile is created and cleaned

doc/Makefile.in

	- `bash.html' is now a makefile target, created by man2html from
	  bash.1 rather than being hand-modified

lib/sh/itos.c, general.c
	- new file, itos() from general.c.  This is here because the
	  implementation of strerror in lib/sh/strerror.c uses itos()

Makefile.in, lib/sh/Makefile.in
	- changes to add itos.c in libsh.a

externs.h, general.h
	- moved extern declaration of itos() from general.h to externs.h

aclocal.m4

	  before trying to do anything with it

jobs.c
	- add a call to internal_warning from wait_for_job if the job is
	  stopped
	- changed notify_of_job_status to not report pipelines exiting due to
	  SIGPIPE in non-interactive shells if the shell is compiled with
	  -DDONT_REPORT_SIGPIPE

builtins/psize.sh
	- some fixes to try to avoid /tmp file races and surreptitious
	  substitutions

version.c
	- changed the extended version info to show 1998 as the copyright year

parse.y
	- fixes from Andreas Schwab <schwab@LS5.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>
	  for compilation errors when the shell is configured --disable-alias
	  but with dparen arithmetic enabled

eval.c
	- fixes from Andreas Schwab <schwab@LS5.informatik.uni-dortmund.de> to
	  make sure the input stream is popped correctly when performing an
	  array assignment in the command argument to `bash -c', e.g.,
	  `bash -c 'A=()''

builtins/kill.def
	- make `kill' with no arguments print a usage message and return a
	  failure status

alias.c
	- fix so that rd_token doesn't dump core when trying to do alias
	  expansion on a line containing an unclosed single quote (fix from
	  Vasco Pedro <vp@di.fct.unl.pt>)

builtins/cd.def
	- fix so that using a non-empty directory from CDPATH to construct
	  the name of the directory to change to results in an absolute
	  pathname of the new current working directory being displayed,
	  as POSIX.2 specifies

support/bashbug.sh
	- a couple of small fixes to minimize /tmp file races -- the script
	  is still raceable, the window is just smaller

variables.c
	- make sure assign_in_env passes a malloc'd string to
	  expand_string_unsplit, because some of the error code assumes that
	  it is malloc'd and frees it (bug reported by Marko.Makela@HUT.FI)

				   3/25
				   ----
doc/bashref.texi
	- changed the email addresses to use the @email texinfo tag

trap.c
	- call reset_parser from the exit trap code before calling
	  parse_and_execute, so reserved words are parsed correctly

subst.c
	- make sure parameter_brace_patsub expands the pattern string as if
	  the expression were not in double quotes, even if the entire
	  expansion is enclosed in double quotes, so that quote removal
	  on embedded double quotes is performed correctly (bug report from
	  schwab@issan.informatik.uni-dortmund.de)

				   3/27
				   ----
support/config.guess
	- changes to allow Power PCs running Apple's Rhapsody to configure

				   3/31
				   ----

Makefile.in
	- changed release status to `beta2'

[bash-2.02-beta2 frozen]

				    4/6
				    ---
subst.c
	- make sure command_substitute does not try to set the terminal's
	  process group to a background job

[bash-2.02 frozen]
