				   ----
builtins/common.c
	- display_signal_list: if 0 is supplied as an argument to kill -l,
	  display a signal-out-of-range error.  Fixes bug reported by
	  Martijn Dekker <martijn@inlv.org>

				   9/18
				   ----
print_cmd.c
	- print_heredoc_bodies: take a list of redirections, all here documents,
	  and print the here-document bodies including the ending delimiter,
	  followed by a newline
	- print_redirection_list: print the heredoc headers the first time
	  through the list of redirections so we print them in the same left-
	  to-right order they're supplied; print the bodies and delimiters with
	  print_heredoc_bodies after we print all the redirections if we're
	  not printing a list of commands (printing_connection == 0).  Fix for
	  problem reported by Isabella Parakiss <izaberina@gmail.com>
	- print_deferred_heredocs: don't print heredoc headers, since they're
	  now printed in print_redirection_list
	- print_deferred_heredocs: use print_heredoc_bodies

				   9/20
				   ----
builtins/mapfile.def
	- readarray: update usage synopsis to include -d delim.  Report and
	  fix from jhankins@homewood.k12.al.us

test.c
	- test_binop: if op[0] == '-', make sure op[1] != 0 before checking
	  op[2] or op[3].  Fixes out-of-bounds read reported by Franco
	  Costantini <franco.costantini.20@gmail.com>

parse.y
	- cond_term: if yylval.word->word[0] == '-' make sure word[1] != 0
	  before checking word[2] and calling test_unop.  Fixes out-of-bounds
	  read reported by Franco Costantini <franco.costantini.20@gmail.com>
	- make sure to check all instances of the return value of the
	  simple_command production before trying to hook redirections onto it,
	  since it can potentially return NULL.
	  Reported by Franco Costantini <franco.costantini.20@gmail.com>

				   9/21
				   ----
parse.y
	- token_is_assignment: make sure to check that the return value from
	  assignment() finds the `=' we just added at index I to avoid false
	  positives from g=g=g=g=g=g=().  Reported by Franco Costantini
	  <franco.costantini.20@gmail.com>

				   9/22
				   ----
parse.y
	- token_is_assignment: if we're not using the bash malloc (which has
	  guard bytes after the requested allocation size), use a new
	  buffer so we can make sure it's big enough to hold the current
	  token and at least two additional characters.  Reported by
	  Franco Costantini <franco.costantini.20@gmail.com>

				   9/23
				   ----
execute_command.c
	- execute_in_subshell: call without_job_control for both job control
	  and non-job-control builds to avoid waiting for last_made_pid
	  inherited from parent shell.  Related to fix from 8/4 to
	  initialize_subshell.  Fixes bug reported by Martijn Dekker
	  <martijn@inlv.org>

builtins/declare.def
	- local_builtin: allow `local --help' to work even when not executing
	  a function. Suggestion from Norm Abramovitz <norm@starkandwayne.com>

				   9/25
				   ----
builtins/printf.def
	- bexpand: if passed a null or empty string, return a newly-allocated
	  empty string (so the return value can always be freed) instead of
	  NULL.
	- printstr: if passed a null string, treat it as if it were an empty
	  string so any precision or fieldwidth arguments are handled
	  correctly.  Report from isabella parakiss <izaberina@gmail.com>

subst.c
	- skip_matched_pair: make the flags argument of 1 affect whether or
	  not backslash can quote characters in the string, so it affects
	  all quoting mechanisms

arrayfunc.c
	- unbind_array_element: now takes a third (flags) argument; flags&1
	  means to not expand an associative array index. This is only called
	  from a shell builtin context, which means the argument should have
	  already undergone word expansion, so it should be ok.  Will still
	  be a problem for uses like "unset -v 'var[$ind]'", quoted to avoid
	  globbing
	- valid_array_reference: pass second flags argument to skipsubscript;
	  still set to 0 by all callers

arrayfunc.h
	- unbind_array_element: updated prototype

builtins/set.def
	- unset_builtin: add third argument of 1 to unbind_array_element calls
	  [TEMPORARILY DISABLED]
	- unset_builtin: call valid_array_reference with second arg of 1 to
	  handle unmatched pairs of quotes and [/]

array.c
	- array_reference: optimize access locality as well as sequential
	  access by adding ability to start from last-accessed element and move
	  backwards or forwards depending on the desired index.  Inspired by
	  report from Tom McCurdy <tom.j.mccurdy@gmail.com> and followup from
	  Christian Franke <Christian.Franke@t-online.de>

variables.c
	- all_array_variables: include associative arrays, not just indexed
	  arrays.  Reported by Grisha Levit <grishalevit@gmail.com>

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_disk_command: if we're optimizing out the fork (CMD_NO_FORK),
	  decrement the shell level so we don't end up incrementing it twice.
	  We should decrement the shell level for an implicit exec like an
	  explicit one.  Reported by Stephane Chazelas
	  <stephane.chazelas@gmail.com>

builtins/exec.def
	- exec_builtin: don't bother to decrement the shell level if we are
	  already in a `(command)' subshell.  Reported by Stephane Chazelas
	  <stephane.chazelas@gmail.com>

lib/readline/macro.c
	- macro_level: count of macro nesting level, maintained by
	  _rl_push_executing_macro and _rl_pop_executing macro
	- _rl_with_macro_input: if current nesting level exceeds
	  MAX_MACRO_LEVEL, abort the current command line with _rl_abort_internal
	  and return to the top level.  Reported by Christian Klomp
	  <christianklomp@gmail.com>

lib/readine/history.c
	- add_history: if allocating the history list for the first time,
	  make sure the max history list size isn't so large that it will
	  cause allocation errors.  Cap it at MAX_HISTORY_INITIAL_SIZE
	  (8192).  Reported by Sean Zha <freeman_cha@hotmail.com>

jobs.c
	- wait_for: if a foreground job with job control enabled is killed by a
	  SIGINT and sourcelevel != 0, act as if we received the SIGINT so the
	  file sourcing can be terminated.  Reported by PePa
	  <peterkelly@passchier.net>

				   9/26
				   ----
subst.c
	- read_comsub: only warn once for null bytes in command substitution
	  output, instead of once for every null byte

arrayfunc.c
	- array_variable_part: now takes a `flags' argument; changed all callers
	  to initially pass 0
	- array_variable_name: now takes a `flags' argument; changed all callers
	  to initially pass 0
	- array_variable_name: pass `flags' argument to skipsubscript instead
	  of just passing 0

arrayfunc.h
	- array_variable_{name,part}: added new argument to prototypes

				   9/29
				   ----
bashline.c
	- bash_directory_completion_hook: don't bother to try and expand a
	  ${ or $( that isn't complete; expand_prompt_string will complain.
	  Fixes reports from John Passaro <john.a.passaro@gmail.com> and
	  Valentin Bajrami <valentin.bajrami@gmail.com>

lib/readline/history.c
	- _hs_append_history_line: use a strategy that attempts to avoid
	  realloc copying memory to a newly-allocated block if the history
	  line we're appending to gets `too long' (currently 256 bytes).
	  We reallocate in powers of 2 starting at 512, and rely on realloc
	  not allocating a new block and copying into it if the size is the
	  same as the last call to realloc.  Addresses issue raised by
	  Hubert Schmid <h.schmid@gmx.de>

trap.h
	- check_signals: new extern declaration
	- trapped_signal_received: new extern declaration

builtins/read.def
	- read_builtin: if one of the zread* functions returns < 0 (which
	  usually only happens in Posix mode), make sure we call check_signals()
	  before eventually calling run_pending_traps() because zread() isn't
	  going to call it
	- include trap.h for correct extern functions and variable declarations

lib/sh/zread.c
	- zread: if executing a builtin, call check_signals_and_traps() for
	  backwards compatibility.  If not, call check_signals() only, because
	  we don't want to run traps during, for instance, reading command
	  substitution output.  Fixes race condition bug reported by Luiz Angelo
	  Daros de Luca <luizluca@gmail.com>

				   9/30
				   ----
subst.c
	- command_substitute: reset parse_and_execute_level to 0 in the child
	  process, since it's independent of the other parse_and_execute
	  calls.  Adds command substitution inside other parse_and_execute
	  calls optimizations to suppress forks, as suggested by
	  Martijn Dekker <martijn@inlv.org>

				   10/3
				   ----
configure.ac
	- SHOBJ_STATUS: make sure it defaults to unsupported and is substituted
	  if the shobj-conf script isn't run.  Fixes `make install' bug with
	  a minimal config reported by Andrew Tomazos <andrewtomazos@gmail.com>

				   10/5
				   ----
support/shobj-conf
	- darwin: set compatibility_version for a shared build of the readline
	  library (the standalone readline distribution shares this file) to
	  $(SHLIB_MAJOR)$(SHLIB_MINOR).  Recommendation from Max Horn
	  <max@quendi.de>

				   10/6
				   ----
array.h
	- array_first_index: new convenience define

array.c
	- ADD_AFTER: new define, complement of ADD_BEFORE
	- UNSET_LASTREF: now takes an array as an argument, prepping for move
	  of lastref pointer into the array struct
	- array_insert: check whether we are adding at the beginning of the
	  array and take a fast path if so
	- array_insert: use same strategy as array_reference to find the place
	  to insert, starting from the last-referenced element and moving
	  forward or back from there; use ADD_AFTER if moving backward
	- array_insert: if replacing an existing element, just replace the
	  value with new->value instead of the entire element
	- array_reference: short-circuit quickly if looking for an element
	  before the first assigned index
	- array_reference: if we don't find the element, leave lastref pointing
	  to the closest element under the assumption we will be assigning or
	  looking for something close
	- array_reference: take advantage of ordered indexes to short-circuit
	  when looking for element that is not set

				   10/7
				   ----
array.c
	- array_remove: short-circuit if asked to remove index after max
	  index or before first index

				   10/10
				   -----
lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- internal_realloc: if we are requesting reallocation to the same size
	  as the block's current size, short-circuit and return `mem' right
	  after doing bounds check
	- internal_realloc: if we are reducing the size of an allocation, and
	  the new size fits in the next lower bin, just keep the same block
	  and adjust the size, so we can avoid some copies

parse.y
	- set_line_mbstate: keep track of the allocated size of
	  shell_input_line_property, only request reallocation if the size
	  increases, but don't let it get too big

				   10/11
				   -----
jobs.c
	- wait_for_background_pids: make sure we wait for pid in
	  last_procsub_child since it's not found in any job -- still needs
	  more work to wait for multiple process substitutions

subst.c
	- process_substitute: if make_child fails, make sure we call
	  restore_pipeline to undo the previous save_pipeline()

				   10/15
				   -----
subst.c
	- process_substitute,command_substitute: leave subshell_level (reflected
	  as $BASH_SUBSHELL) intact for any exit trap instead of decrementing
	  it.  Suggested by Martijn Dekker <martijn@inlv.org>

builtins/evalstring.c
	- optimize_subshell_command: new function, framework for optimizing
	  out forks for command that have already forked and are executing
	  in a subshell. Not used yet

expr.c
	- readtok: if we have a post-increment or post-decrement, and the
	  previous token is not a string, check whether the previous token is
	  a number that results from a pre-increment or pre-decrement, and
	  make that an error.  Report from Conrad Hoffmann <ch@bitfehler.net>

				   10/16
				   -----
aclocal.m4
	- BASH_JOB_CONTROL_MISSING: convert from AC_TRY_RUN to AC_TRY_COMPILE
	  with existing set of preprocessor defines, so it can work when
	  cross-compiling.  Suggested by Felix Janda <felix.janda@posteo.de>

				   10/19
				   -----
variables.c
	- get_bashpid: BASHPID is no longer readonly; assignments to it are
	  just ignored.

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- BASHPID: note that assignments are ignored and unsetting BASHPID
	  causes it to lose its special properties

				   10/28
				   -----
builtins/pushd.def
	- popd_builtin: make sure to check the normalized stack offset
	  (i.e., negatives counting back from the end of the stack) is within
	  bounds before trying to free that stack entry.  Report from
	  Fernando Muñoz <fernando@null-life.com>

lib/readline/histfile.c
	- chown: protect calls with HAVE_CHOWN.  Fixes for MinGW{64,32} from
	  J. Peter Mugaas <jpmugaas@suddenlink.net>

lib/readline/colors.c
	- S_ISDIR: add define if missing
	- S_ISUID, S_ISGID, S_ISLNK, S_ISSOCK: don't use unless defined.
	  Fixes for MinGW{64,32} from J. Peter Mugaas <jpmugaas@suddenlink.net>

bashhist.c
	- current_command_line_comment: set to the most recent line in a
	  possibly multi-line command that contains a shell comment; set in
	  maybe_add_history and bash_add_history to either the current
	  command number or -2
	- maybe_add_history: set current_command_line_comment for first line
	  of command
	- bash_add_history: chars_to_add set to "\n" if the current command line
	  is one greater than the previous line containing a comment
	  (current_command_line_comment).  Fixes complaint from back in
	  January, 2016 from Dave Rutherford <dave@evilpettingzoo.com>

array.h
	- lastref: move last-referenced pointer into each array struct, so all
	  arrays can have reference locality

array.c
	- array_create: set lastref element to 0
	- array_copy: if copying the lastref in array a, set the new lastref
	  in the copy to the same element
	- IS_LASTREF, LASTREF_START, LASTREF, INVALIDATE_LASTREF, SET_LASTREF,
	  UNSET_LASTREF: change to use new array `lastref' member

pathexp.c
	- quote_string_for_globbing: if quoting for a regexp, make sure to
	  skip and copy a leading `^' in a bracket expression, and skip and
	  copy a subsequent `]' (after an optional `^'), so that leading
	  bracket doesn't close the bracket expression.  Report from
	  Stephane Chazelas <stephane.chazelas@gmail.com>

				   10/29
				   -----
subst.c
	- extract_delimited_string: add calls to CHECK_STRING_OVERRUN for
	  $( inside $((, nested OPENERs, nested ALT_OPENERs, and backquotes
	- skip_to_delim: add calls to CHECK_STRING_OVERRUN for $(, ${,
	  process substitution
	- extract_dollar_brace_string: add calls to CHECK_STRING_OVERRUN for
	  $(
	- extract_dollar_brace_string: use skipsubscript to skip over the
	  array subscript in ${var[sub]} (non-quoted case uses string_extract,
	  which already uses skipsubscript).  Tagged for bash-5.0

				   10/30
				   -----
variables.c
	- EPOCHSECONDS: new dynamic variable, time in seconds since Unix
	  epoch; assignments are ignored.  Can be used on systems where
	  strftime() doesn't support '%s'
	- EPOCHREALTIME: new dynamic variable, time in seconds since Unix
	  epoch with microsecond granularity

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- EPOCHSECONDS documentation
	- EPOCHREALTIME documentation

execute_cmd.c
	- decpoint: moved to locale.c, renamed locale_decpoint; changed callers

{bashintl,externs}.h
	- locale_decpoint: extern declaration or #define if support for
	  localeconv() not there

				   10/31
				   -----
lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- posix_memalign: add new posix-mandated interface

examples/loadables/rm.c
	- rm: minimal loadable builtin, removes files and directories, only
	  handles -r and -f options.  Original from Tim Ruehsen
	  <tim.ruehsen@gmx.de>, heavily rewritten for inclusion as loadable

examples/loadables/Makefile.in
	- rm: add rules to build rm as one of the `other' targets

examples/loadables/stat.c
	- stat: new loadable builtin that takes a filename and loads the info
	  returned by stat(2) into an associative array specified by the -A
	  argument (default STAT)

				   11/1
				   ----
variables.c
	- BASH_ARGV0: new dynamic variable, returns $0 on reference and sets
	  $0 on assignment.  From a suggestion from  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>
	  a few years ago

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- BASH_ARGV0: document

				   11/2
				   ----
lib/glob/sm_loop.c
	- parse_collsym: make sure to not return an out-of-bounds read if a
	  collating symbol is unterminated.  Fixes OOB read reported by
	  Jerzy Kramarz <op7ica@gmail.com>
	- brackmatch: after incrementing p, before checking whether it's a
	  character range, check whether *p was NULL before the increment
	  and short-circuit the bracket expression if it is

jobs.c
	- discard_last_procsub_child: new function, safely discards
	  last_procsub_child and sets it to NULL

subst.c
	- process_substitute: call discard_last_procsub_child instead of
	  calling discard_pipeline directly.  Fixes bug reported by
	  Christian Weisgerber <naddy@mips.inka.de>

				   11/3
				   ----
shell.h
	- EX_DISKFALLBACK: new special return status available to builtins;
	  means to attempt to execute a disk command with the same name as
	  the builtin

examples/loadables/rm.c
	- if we see the -i option, return EX_DISKFALLBACK

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_simple_command: if executing a builtin returns EX_DISKFALLBACK,
	  try running execute_disk_command instead 

bashline.c
	- shell_expand_line: use expand_word to expand the readline line
	  buffer, which allows us to pass flags with the word. If a numeric
	  argument is supplied, do not perform quote removal (pass
	  Q_HERE_DOCUMENT since here-doc quoting does the right thing) and
	  do not perform command or process subsitution.  From a suggestion
	  by Dabrien 'Dabe' Murphy <dabe@dabe.com> based on an old bug-bash
	  discussion

subst.c
	- expand_word_internal: note that we have added a quoted IFS char to
	  istring by setting sentinel has_quoted_ifs.  Usually we only add
	  one if we are not going to be performing word splitting, but we
	  will not perform word splitting if there's no expansion, so we need
	  to take care of that case
	- expand_word_internal: when performing final word split, if there are
	  no expansions but has_quoted_ifs is non-zero, call remove_quoted_ifs()
	  to remove any quoted ifs characters we added while processing
	- remove_quoted_ifs: new function, removes CTLESC chars preceding
	  (single-byte) chars in IFS. Used when we are not performing word
	  splitting.  Fixes bug reported by Martijn Dekker <martijn@inlv.org>

				   11/4
				   ----
lib/readline/macro.c
	- _rl_peek_macro_key: return the next character from the current
	  keyboard macro; the next character from the `next' keyboard macro,
	  if there is one, if at the end of the current macro; or 0 to
	  indicate that we are at the end of a keyboard macro sequence

lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- _rl_peek_macro_key: extern declaration

lib/readline/readline.c
	- _rl_dispatch_subseq: add test for ESC at the end of a keyboard macro,
	  which should cause the keyboard timeout for ESC to kick in.  The
	  previous test didn't run the timeout code if executing from a macro,
	  even if we had read the last character of the macro.  Fixes bug
	  reported by Clark Wang <clarkw@vmware.com>

lib/glob/sm_loop.c
	- GMATCH: allow trailing backslash in pattern to explicitly match a
	  backslash that is the last character in the string.  Bug report from
	  Stephane Chazelas <stephane.chazelas@gmail.com>

				   11/5
				   ----
builtins/common.c
	- display_signal_list: if displaying a signal name corresponding to an
	  exit status > 128, don't display the SIG prefix at all.  Old code
	  made displaying the SIG prefix dependent on JOB_CONTROL define.
	  Report and fix from Martijn Dekker <martijn@inlv.org>

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_subshell_builtin_or_function: call without_job_control even
	  if JOB_CONTROL is not defined. Similar to fix from 9/23.
	  Report from Martijn Dekker <martijn@inlv.org>

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_simple_command: free memory allocated and passed to
	  make_child in the child process if JOB_CONTROL is defined
	- execute_command_internal: free memory allocated and passed to
	  make_child in the child process created to run a () subshell or a
	  compound command within a pipeline if JOB_CONTROL is defined
	- execute_coproc: free memory allocated and passed to make_child in
	  the child process if JOB_CONTROL is defined
	- execute_disk_command: free memory allocated and passed to
	  make_child in the child process if JOB_CONTROL is defined.  This
	  series of fixes is the result of reports from
	  Eduardo A. Bustamante López <dualbus@gmail.com>

				   ----
lib/sh/unicode.c
	- u32toutf16: fix to prevent outputting broken surrogate pairs for
	  Japanese locales (ja_JP.UTF-8) on cygwin (which uses UTF-16 natively).
	  Report and fix from Koichi MURASE <myoga.murase@gmail.com>

builtins/trap.def
	- trap_builtin: if OP is `-' (revert), set the SIGINT signal handler
	  to sigint_sighandler if the shell is interactive and sourcing a
	  file (interactive_shell && sourcelevel) or running a trap
	  (interactive_shell && running_trap) even if it's not currently
	  interactive.  Report from Martijn Dekker <martijn@inlv.org>

builtins/read.def
	- check for and read multibyte characters in all cases, not just when
	  we are reading a specific number of characters, as long as
	  mb_cur_max > 1

subst.c
	- expand_word_internal: some improvements to code that converts istring
	  into a WORD_LIST * to avoid multiple allocations and copies of
	  istring, which is already malloc'ed memory -- reduce number of malloc
	  and free calls

test.c
	- unary_test: make sure if we test -v array[@] or array[*] that we
	  free the return value from array_value

				   11/8
				   ----
expr.c
	- expcond: make sure to set `noeval' before reading tokens depending on
	  the result of the conditional test, since readtok() can evaluate
	  identifiers (and recursively those containing expressions).  Report
	  and fix from Koichi MURASE <myoga.murase@gmail.com>

builtins/evalstring.c
	- should_suppress_fork: make sure to check for traps on EXIT and
	  ERR, since any_signals_trapped() only checks for `real' signals,
	  not the fake shell ones.  Fixes bug reported by Werner Fink
	  <werner@suse.de>
	- optimize_subshell_command: ditto

				   11/9
				   ----
eval.c
	- reader_loop: change so that we don't reset the SIGINT handler every
	  time through the command loop in an interactive shell if the signal
	  is trapped (as the comment noted).  Reported by Report from Martijn
	  Dekker <martijn@inlv.org>

subst.c
	- parameter_brace_{patsub,remove_pattern,transform,casemod}: save and
	  restore this_command_name while temporarily setting it for use in
	  error messages.  Fixes use-after-free error reported by
	  Jerzy Kramarz <op7ica@gmail.com>
	- string_extract_verbatim: make sure when we increment i by 2 due to
	  a CTLESC or CTLESC-CTLNUL that we don't read past the end of the
	  string. This can happen if the string ends with an odd number of
	  CTLESC chars. Fixes oob-read error reported by
	  Jerzy Kramarz <op7ica@gmail.com>

				   11/11
				   -----
configure.ac,aclocal.m4
	- BASH_FUNC_SBRK: make sure sbrk actually works, instead of being just
	  a stub function like on several Linux distributions

lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- malloc_usable_size: return the maximum number of bytes available for
	  a particular memory allocation (size of block allocated for it)

				   11/12
				   -----
configure.ac
	- changes to make --enable-profiling work on Linux (-pg, no static link,
	  no -static in LDFLAGS)

Makefile.in
	- changes to make --enable-profiling work on Linux (take
	  ${PROFILE_FLAGS} out of  BASE_CCFLAGS, add to CCFLAGS instead; add
	  BASE_LDFLAGS define that doesn't include -pg or -static; use
	  BASE_LDFLAGS in LDFLAGS; move ${PROFILE_FLAGS} and ${STATIC_LD} to

	- changes to make profiling test suite with gprof work on Linux (set
	  GMON_OUT_PREFIX to handle multiple profiled processes per test;
	  change default filename to gmon.out from bash.gmon; look for
	  gprof output files in ${TMPDIR} instead of /tmp; handle multiple

locale.c
	- locale_isutf8: use locale_charset() if it's available and nl_langinfo
	  isn't
	- locale_isutf8: add code to parse a locale specification and determine
	  whether the encoding is UTF-8 (or utf8) in the absence of
	  nl_langinfo and locale_charset
	- set_default_locale: make sure to set locale_utf8locale early on

lib/readline/display.c
	- rl_redisplay: handle report of potential integer overflow in

lib/sh/mbschr.c
	- mbschr: if in a UTF-8 locale (locale_utf8locale) and we are looking
	  for an ASCII character, use (essentially) strchr as a shortcut

lib/sh/shmbchar.c
	- utf8_{mbstrlen,mblen,mbsmbchar,mbsnlen}: UTF-8-specific replacement
	  functions (should also be able to use utf8_mblen in subst.c:
	  string_extract_verbatim)
	- mbsmbchar: if locale_utf8locale is true, call utf8_mbsmbchar
	- mbsmbchar: in UTF-8 locale, use utf8_mblen instead of mbrlen (not
	  used if earlier shortcut taken)

lib/sh/unicode.c
	- u32cconv: don't use nl_langinfo early to call u32toutf8()
	- u32cconv: use locale_utf8locale to set utf8locale
	- u32cconv: when initializing (u32init == 0), use locale_charset, then
	  nl_langinfo, then stub_charset to determine the charset
	- u32cconv: even if we don't have iconv, if locale_utf8locale is non-

lib/readiline/rlprivate.h
	- _rl_init_locale: new extern declaration

lib/readline/readline.c
	- rl_initialize: if not initializing everything the first time, call
	  _rl_init_locale to check current locale and set _rl_utf8locale

lib/readline/text.c
	- _rl_insert_char: optimize cases where we are inserting a single-byte
	  character in a locale with multibyte characters
	- _rl_insert_char: check whether character is single byte if we know
	  we are in a UTF-8 locale, optimize single-byte case to avoid calls
	  to mbrtowc and memmove/memcpy

lib/readline/mbutil.c
	- _rl_char_value: if we are in a UTF-8 locale (_rl_utf8locale) and the
	  current character does not have the eighth bit set ((c & 0x80) == 0),
	  return that char without bothering to call mbrtowc
	- _rl_adjust_point: don't bother calling mbrlen if we are in a UTF-8
	  locale and the current character is not a multibyte character
	- _rl_find_next_mbchar_internal: if we are in a UTF-8 locale, use that

lib/readline/histsearch.c
	- history_search_internal: now takes a `flags' argument instead of just
	  an `anchored' argument to accommodate PATTERN_SEARCH
	- _hs_history_patsearch: new internal interface to use when flags
	  specify PATTERN_SEARCH

lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- SF_PATTERN: new flag for non-incremental search contexts, means to
	  treat search string as a pattern (maps to PATTERN_SEARCH)

lib/readline/search.c
	- noninc_dosearch: takes an additional `flags' argument for SF_PATTERN
	- noninc_search_from_pos: takes an additional `flags' argument for
	  SF_PATTERN
	- noninc_dosearch: pass flags argument through to noninc_search_from_pos
	- _rl_nsearch_init: if we are in vi command mode, and `pchar' (key used
	  to invoke the search) is `?' or `/', add SF_PATTERN to the flags
	  to conform to Posix spec for vi-mode editing
	- _rl_nsearch_dosearch: if cxt->sflags indicates that we should do a
	  pattern search, pass SF_PATTERN to noninc_search_from_pos
	- rl_noninc_forward_search_again: if in vi command mode and key == `N',
	  make sure flags arg passed to noninc_dosearch includes SF_PATTERN
	- rl_noninc_reverse_search_again: if in vi command mode and key == `n',

	- rl_history_search_internal: pass newcol pointer to
	  noninc_search_from_pos to avoid having to recompute the match offset
	  in the matching history entry

config.h.in
	- define HAVE_FNMATCH if we have the fnmatch function (configure was
	  already checking for it)

lib/readline/histsearch.c
	- _hs_history_patsearch: transform the pattern into one ending in a
	  `*' to avoid having to perform multiple match attempts from each
	  index in the history line
	- history_search_internal: changes to handle pattern matching if
	  PATTERN_SEARCH is in the flags and HAVE_FNMATCH is defined.  This

	- command_substitute: pass through flags argument to read_comsub
	- read_comsub: now takes additional new flags argument to indicate
	  whether or not the word is in a context where word splitting will
	  eventually be performed
	- read_comsub: if we are running in a context where word splitting
	  will not take place (PF_ASSIGNRHS), we read a CTLESC, and CTLESC is
	  in $IFS, add a CTLESC to make sure it gets through a round of
	  dequoting

bashhist.h

flags.[ch]
	- histexp_flag: new variable, this is what set -H/set -o histexpand
	  sets; history_expansion set to value of this variable; defaults to 0
	- history_expansion: now set to HISTEXPAND_DEFAULT

bashhist.c
	- bash_history_reinit: if interact == 0, set history_expansion to the
	  value of histexp_flag, to allow -H option to enable history
	  expansion
	- bash_history_reinit: if interact == 0, make sure
	  history_expansion_inhibited is set opposite of histexp_flag, so
	  enabling history expansion with -H invocation option turns off
	  inhibited expansion. If interactive shell, we turn it off so
	  history_expansion controls whether or not history expansion takes
	  place. In practice, this function is always called with interact == 0,
	  and -c command still doesn't perform history expansion

shell.c
	- init_interactive: make sure histexp_flag and history_expansion are
	  identical in an interactive shell; allows both -H/+H option and
	  default compilation options (HISTEXPAND_DEFAULT) to work

subst.c
	- expand_word_internal: if we're expanding a quoted string containing

	  we're expanding an array subscript (Q_ARRAYSUB), not if we're
	  expanding any arithmetic expression (Q_ARITH).  This fixes a
	  backwards compatibility issue with expressions like ~0 reported by

subst.c
	- parameter_brace_expand_indir: if the variable is not special and
	  the indirect variable is unset (!variable where variable is unset),

	- _rl_get_char_len: look at at most MB_CUR_MAX characters, but maybe
	  fewer if the length of the string is less

builtins/bind.def
	- unbind_keyseq: new function for the -r option; checks whether the
	  key sequence is actually bound before trying to bind it to NULL.
	  Partial fix for https://savannah.gnu.org/support/?109329

parse.y
	- augment `error yacc_EOF' production to call YYABORT in non-interactive
	  shells or calls to parse_and_execute (eval, command substitution,
	  etc.) Fixes bug reported by Martijn Dekker <martijn@inlv.org>

				   ----
bashline.c
	- edit_and_execute_command: don't add rl_line_buffer to the history
	  list if it's empty; consistent with how other code treats an empty
	  line

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_builtin: make sure to preserve the temporary env across the
	  execution of the `read' builtin or `fc' builtin if HISTORY is
	  defined, in case `read -e' calls edit-and-execute-command.  Should
	  have no side effects. Reported by Eduardo Bustamante
	  <dualbus@gmail.com>

general.c
	- line_isblank: new function: returns true if passed string is composed
	  entirely of blanks

general.h
	- line_isblank: new extern declaration

parse.y
	- history_delimiting_chars: return "" for a blank line, since there's
	  nothing to delimit with `;'

jobs.c
	- wait_for: make sure to call restore_sigint_handler before returning
	  if we return out of the loop due to no children. Report from
	  Eduardo Bustamante <dualbus@gmail.com>

subst.c
	- expand_word_internal: if split_on_spaces is set, and the word is
	  unquoted, and IFS is null, split the results of the previous steps
	  on $' \t\n' instead of just ' '. This relies on the previous steps
	  quoting the portions of the word that should not be split.  Fixes
	  bug reported by Kevin Brodsky <corax26@gmail.com>

expr.c
	- evalexp: after running expr_unwind, make sure we reset expr_depth
	  to 0 for the next call
	- expr_streval: if after a call to get_array_value (which can call
	  the expression evaluator recursively) we discover that expr_depth
	  is less than it was before we called it, we assume there has been
	  some kind of error and an expr_unwind, so we treat it as an
	  error and either longjmp back to the expression top level or return
	  0 immediately. Fixes bug reported by Eduardo Bustamante
	  <dualbus@gmail.com>

general.[ch]
	- default_columns: new function, returns the value of COLUMNS, or
	  refreshes it if check_window_size is set and COLUMNS is unset. By
	  default, it returns 80

execute_cmd.c
	- select_query: use default_columns() instead of fetching value of
	  COLUMNS directly

builtins/help.def
	- show_builtin_command_help: use default_columns() instead of fetching
	  value of COLUMNS directly

builtins/read.def
	- read_builtin: call QUIT during the read loop, just in case we get a
	  signal we should act on that didn't cause read to be interrupted.
	  Fixes https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1466737
	- read_builtin: if -n or -N is supplied with a 0 argument, try a zero-
	  length read to detect errors and return failure if that read returns
	  a value < 0. Suggested by dualbus@gmail.com

				    7/4
				    ---
bashhist.c
	- maybe_add_history: keep track of whether the current line is a shell
	  comment, even if we're not adding it because it's in a multi-line
	  command, so we use appropriate delimiters between it and any
	  subsequent lines. Fixes bug reported by Grisha Levit
	  <grishalevit@gmail.com> back on 2/28/2017

bashline.c
	- operate_and_get_next: if given an explicit argument, use that to
	  choose which line in the history to use.

lib/readline/doc/rluser.texi,doc/bash.1
	- operate-and-get-next: document new effect of explicit numeric arg

lib/readline/complete.c

builtins/printf.def
	- PRETURN,printf_builtin: check variable returned by bind_printf_variable,

	  because the variable is marked readonly or noassign. Fixes bug
	  reported by Arnaud Gaillard <arnaud.mgaillard@gmail.com>

				    ---
lib/readline/text.c
	- rl_quoted_insert: new feature: a negative argument means to insert
	  the next -COUNT characters using quoted-insert. Original feature
	  from Jason Hood <jadoxa@yahoo.com.au>. Still needs work on
	  redisplay
	- _rl_insert_next_callback: implement support for negative arguments
	  similar to rl_quoted_insert: we just insert one at a time and keep
	  increasing the count until it hits 0

lib/readline/misc.c
	- _rl_arg_callback: if the return value from _rl_arg_dispatch indicates
	  we should keep reading a numeric argument, update the message with
	  the new arg value

				    7/8
				    ---
lib/readline/signals.c
	- _rl_handle_signal: make sure all uses of any of the job control
	  signals are protected by a check for SIGTSTP being defined.  Report
	  from Juan Manuel Guerrero <juan.guerrero@gmx.de>

				   7/11
				   ----
lib/readline/vi_mode.c
	- rl_vi_replace: when making the new keymap for vi replacement mode,
	  make sure that ANYOTHERKEY is set correctly, otherwise some input
	  will cause _rl_dispatch to return -2 to the top level.  Fixes fuzzing
	  bug reported by Ben Wong <benjamin.a.wong@gmail.com>

				   7/19
				   ----
builtins/read.def
	- struct ttsave: make the attrs member a struct, not a pointer, to force
	  a structure copy that will survive a longjmp to another context.
	  Leaving it as a pointer to a local struct is not portable

				   9/10
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- execute_builtin: make sure that we set up the unwind-protect for
	  pop_scope (temporary_env is non-zero) so that the temporary env
	  is propagated to the current environment only for special builtins
	  (source/eval/unset) not run by the command builtin
	  (flags & CMD_COMMAND_BUILTIN == 0).  Fixes bug reported by
	  Martijn Dekker <martijn@inlv.org>

				   9/17
				   ----
builtins/printf.def
	- asciicode: don't use mblen to check whether or not a character is a

{jobs,subst}.h
	- move declaration of last_command_subst_pid to subst.h, since it's
	  declared in subst.c and doesn't depend on job control. Reported by
	  Martijn Dekker <martijn@inlv.org>

builtins/read.def,variables.c
	- fixed a couple of problems (READLINE, ARRAY_VARS) that prevented
	  the minimal config from building

				   10/1
				   ----
parse.y
	- special_case_tokens: if we are returning DO in a case where the last
	  two tokens read are `FOR' and `WORD' make sure we decrement
	  expecting_in_token.  Fixes bug reported by Martijn Dekker
	  <martijn@inlv.org>

				   ----
subst.c
	- expand_string_for_rhs: now takes an additional PFLAGS argument from
	  its caller (one so far); passes that through to call_expand_word_internal
	  as W_ASSIGNRHS. Fixes bug reported by Martijn Dekker
	  <martijn@inlv.org>
	- expand_string_for_rhs: expanding b in ${a[:]=b} is now done as if
	  b were the rhs of an assignment statement. This means that splitting
	  isn't done, but tilde expansion is performed as if the statement
	  were `a=b'. Fixes splitting bug with $* reported by Martijn Dekker
	  <martijn@inlv.org>

command.h
	- W_NOASSNTILDE: new word flag, means to not perform tilde expansion
	  following a `:' even if the word has the W_ASSIGNRHS flag enabled

subst.c
	- expand_word_internal: if we see a `:' with the W_NOASSNTILDE flag
	  set, just add the character and inhibit any subsequent tilde
	  expansion. Currently not set anywhere, but it could be set in
	  expand_string_for_rhs to satisfy its peculiar semantics

				   -----
subst.c
	- expand_string_for_rhs: set W_NOASSNTILDE if the operator is `='
	  for backwards compatibility with bash-4.4

shell.c
	- main: set positional parameters before running the startup files,
	  so the startup files can inspect $@.  Often-requested feature,
	  most recently from Stephane Chazelas <stephane.chazelas@gmail.com>

				   10/27
				   -----
doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- Arrays: add some clarifying language to make it clear that array
	  references that don't use the ${a[s]} syntax are subject to
	  globbing when passed as arguments to commands such as unset, and
	  should be quoted for safety. Change prompted by a report from
	  Eli Barzilay <eli@barzilay.org>

parse.y
	- parse_comsub: make sure we don't run off the end of the `ret'
	  buffer when checking for the here doc delimiter.  Report from

builtins/pushd.def
	- get_directory_stack: make sure the current directory (element 0 of
	  the stack) is passed to polite_directory_format under the same
	  conditions as the rest of the stack entries (flags & 1). Otherwise
	  something like `cd ${DIRSTACK[0]}' will fail. Fixes bug reported
	  by Steve Jones <sjml@slohj.org>

builtins/declare.def
	- declare_internal: when checking for a `[' to see whether or not this
	  is an array variable declaration (declare -a foo[12]), make sure
	  we don't do the check if we're just dealing with shell functions.
	  Bug and pointer to fix from PJ Eby <pje@telecommunity.com>

				   11/1
				   ----
parse.y
	- parse_comsub: if we read a four-character word followed by a break
	  character, and that word is not one of the reserved words, set
	  lex_rwlen to 0 since we are no longer in a reserved word. It only
	  hurts if another break character immediately follows, so that test
	  succeeds again. Turn off the RESWDOK flag only if it's not a shell
	  metacharacter, too. Fixes bug reported by Kjetil Torgrim Homme
	  <kjetilho@scribus.ms.redpill-linpro.com>

lib/readline/isearch.c
	- _rl_isearch_dispatch: if we are searching in reverse order, let
	  sline_index go to -1 to avoid searching the same line twice. It
	  gets reset right after that, so there's no danger of indexing into
	  the history line with a negative index.

subst.c
	- do_assignment_internal: if performing a compound assignment, make
	  sure to pass ASS_CHKLOCAL flag to do_compound_assignment if the
	  assignment word has the W_CHKLOCAL flag set
	- do_compound_assignment: honor ASS_CHKLOCAL flag and check for an
	  existing local variable before creating or modifying a global
	  variable

builtins/declare.def
	- declare_internal: new (undocumented so far) option: -G. Means to
	  act on global variables (create, modify) if no local variable is
	  found with the specified name
	- declare_find_variable: new declare-specific wrapper functon for
	  declare builtin; obeys -g and -G options in one place
	- declare_internal: if no variable is found after following any nameref
	  chain, look up the variable using declare_find_variable to honor the
	  -G option. XXX - so far, this is the only place that function is used

subst.c
	- shell_expand_word_list: before calling make_internal_declare, add
	  'G' to the options list if W_CHKLOCAL is set in the word's flags.
	  This makes builtins like `readonly' that modify local variables in
	  a function behave the same for scalar and array variables

	  feature

pcomplete.h
	- COPT_LASTUSER: last flag value used by user-settable completion
	  options
	- PCOMP_RETRYFAIL, PCOMP_NOTFOUND: new #defines, possible return values
	  from programmable_completions in FOUNDP argument. Moved RETRYFAIL
	  define here from pcomplete.c to avoid collisions with user-settable
	  option values (COPT_*)

				   1/15

pcomplete.c
	- programmable_completions: if we don't find any completions for a
	  command, and RETRY is 0, see if the command is a defined alias,
	  expand it, and try to expand the first word of the value as a
	  command, and find any programmable completions for it. Here right
	  now, could be moved to attempt_shell_completion later if we need
	  to do more analysis of the expanded line. We'll see how it works
	  in practice. (Disabled for now.)

lib/readline/display.c
	- update_line: when performing a dumb update after wrapping the line
	  (usually due to printing the prompt), make sure we adjust
	  _rl_last_c_pos if there are invisible characters in prompt lines
	  other than the first (we assume those invisible characters are in
