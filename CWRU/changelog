				 ---------
[bash-4.2 released]

				   2/15
				   ----
lib/glob/gmisc.c
	- fix wmatchlen and umatchlen to avoid going past the end of the
	  string on an incomplete bracket expression that ends with a
	  NUL.  Partial fix for bug reported by Clark Wang <dearvoid@gmail.com>

				   2/16
				   ----
subst.h
	- new string extract flag value: SX_WORD.  Used when calling
	  extract_dollar_brace_string to skip over the word in
	  ${param op word} from parameter_brace_expand

subst.c
	- change parameter_brace_expand to add SX_WORD to flags passed to
	  extract_dollar_brace_string
	- change parameter_brace_expand to use SX_POSIXEXP for all non-posix
	  word expansion operators that treat single quotes as special, not
	  just % and #
	- change extract_dollar_brace_string to initialize dolbrace_state to
	  DOLBRACE_WORD if SX_WORD flag supplied and we shouldn't use
	  DOLBRACE_QUOTE.  Fixes bug reported by Juergen Daubert <jue@jue.li>

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- document the exact expansions here strings undergo

				   2/17
				   ----
lib/readline/vi_mode.c
	- make sure that `dd', `cc', and `yy' call vidomove_dispatch from
	  rl_domove_read_callback.  Fixes bug reported by Clark Wang
	  <dearvoid@gmail.com>

lib/readline/callback.c
	- make sure _rl_internal_char_cleanup is called after the
	  vi-motion callbacks (rl_vi_domove_callback) in rl_callback_read_char.
	  Companion to above fix

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- make sure that the text describing the rhs of the == and =~
	  operators to [[ states that only the quoted portion of the pattern
	  is matched as a string

				   2/18
				   ----
lib/glob/gmisc.c
	- better fix for umatchlen/wmatchlen: keep track of the number of
	  characters in a bracket expression as the value to increase
	  matchlen by if the bracket expression is not well-formed.  Fixes
	  bug reported by Clark Wang <dearvoid@gmail.com>

subst.c
	- change expand_string_for_rhs so that it sets the W_NOSPLIT2 flag
	  in the word flags.  We will not perform word splitting or quote
	  removal on the result, so we do not want to add quoted nulls if
	  we see "" or ''.  Fixes bug reported by Mike Frysinger
	  <vapier@gentoo.org>

				   2/19
				   ----
variables.c
	- new function, int chkexport(name), checks whether variable NAME is
	  exported and remakes the export environment if necessary.  Returns
	  1 if NAME is exported and 0 if not
	- call chkexport(name) to get tzset to look at the right variable in
	  the environment when modifying TZ in sv_tz.  Don't call tzset if
	  chkexport doesn't indicate that the variable is exported

variables.h
	- new extern declaration for chkexport


{parse.y,builtins/printf.def}
	- call sv_tz before calling localtime() when formatting time strings
	  in prompt strings or using printf.  Fixes bug reported by
	  Dennis Williamson <dennistwilliamson@gmail.com>

execute_cmd.c
	- modify fix of 2/9 to add casts when those variables are passed to
	  functions; some compilers throw errors instead of warnings.  Report
	  and fix from Joachim Schmitz <jojo@schmitz-digital.de>

support/shobj-conf
	- add a stanza for nsk on the Tandem from Joachim Schmitz
	  <jojo@schmitz-digital.de>

{shell,lib/readline/shell}.c
	- Tandem systems should use getpwnam (getlogin()); for some reason
	  they don't do well with using getuid().  Fix from Joachim Schmitz
	  <jojo@schmitz-digital.de>

				    3/1
				    ---
variables.c
	- make sure that the return value from find_variable is non-null
	  before trying to use it in chkexport.  Fixes bug reported by
	  Evangelos Foutras <foutrelis@gmail.com>

				    3/3
				    ---
parse.y
	- when adding $$ to the current token buffer in read_token_word(),
	  don't xmalloc a buffer for two characters and then strcpy it, just
	  copy the characters directly into the token buffer.  Fix from
	  Michael Whitten <mfwitten@gmail.com>

execute_cmd.c
	- fix expand_word_unsplit to add the W_NOSPLIT2 flag to the word to
	  be expanded, so "" doesn't add CTLNUL.  Similar to fix of 2/18 to
	  expand_string_for_rhs.  Fixes bug reported by Nathanael D. Noblet
	  <nathanael@gnat.ca> and Matthias Klose <doko@debian.org>

parse.y
	- fix extended_glob case of read_token_word to allocate an extra
	  space in the buffer for the next character read after the extended
	  glob specification if it's a CTLESC or CTLNUL.  Report and fix from
	  Michael Witten <mfwitten@gmail.com>
	- fix shell expansions case of read_token_word to allocate an extra
	  space in the buffer for the next character read after the shell
	  expansion if it's a CTLESC or CTLNUL.  Report and fix from
	  Michael Witten <mfwitten@gmail.com>
	- TENTATIVE: fix read_token_word to reduce the amount of buffer space
	  required to hold the translated and double-quoted value of $"..."
	  strings.  Report and fix from Michael Witten <mfwitten@gmail.com>
	- change code around got_character and got_escaped_character labels to
	  make sure that we call RESIZE_MALLOCED_BUFFER before adding the
	  CTLESC before a CTLESC or CTLNUL, and before adding the character if
	  we're not adding a CTLESC.  Report and fix from
	  Michael Witten <mfwitten@gmail.com>

subst.c
	- new param flags value, PF_ASSIGNRHS, mirrors W_ASSIGNRHS, noting that
	  parameter expansion is on rhs of assignment statement.  That inhibits
	  word splitting
	- change param_expand to call string_list_dollar_at with quoted == 1
	  if PF_ASSIGNRHS is set, so it will quote IFS characters in the
	  positional parameter before separating them with the first char of
	  $IFS.  This keeps the rhs from being split inappropriately.  Fixes
	  bug reported by Andres Perera <andres.p@zoho.com>

				    3/4
				    ---
lib/readline/bind.c
	- add a missing free of `names' in rl_function_dumper.  Bug report
	  and fix from Michael Snyder <msnyder@vmware.com>

				    3/5
				    ---
lib/readline/rltty.c
	- change rl_deprep_terminal so it uses fileno (stdin) for the tty fd
	  if rl_instream is not set, like rl_prep_terminal

				    3/6
				    ---
lib/readline/display.c
	- fix rl_message to use a dynamically-allocated buffer instead of a
	  fixed-size buffer of 128 chars for the `local message prompt'.  Bug
	  report and fix from Micah Cowan <micah@cowan.name>

				    3/7
				    ---
jobs.c
	- add sentinel to wait_sigint_handler so it only sets wait_sigint_received
	  if waiting_for_child is non-zero; otherwise, it restores the old
	  SIGINT handler and sends itself the SIGINT
	- set waiting_for_child around the calls to waitchld that use it to
	  synchronously wait for a process
	- change logic that decides whether or not the child process blocked
	  or handled SIGINT based on whether or not waitpid returns -1/EINTR
	  and the shell receives a SIGINT and the child does not exit.  If
	  the child later exits due to SIGINT, cancel the assumoption that it
	  was handled
	- instead of testing whether or not the child exited due to SIGINT
	  when deciding whether the shell should act on a SIGINT it received
	  while waiting, test whether or not we think the child caught
	  SIGINT.  If it did, we let it go (unless the shell has it trapped);
	  if it did not catch it, the shell acts on the SIGINT.  Fix from
	  Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>, bug report originally
	  from Oleg Nesterov <oleg@redhat.com>

				    3/8
				    ---
shell.c
	- initialize no_line_editing to 1 if READLINE is not defined -- we
	  can't have line editing without readline

				   3/12
				   ----
lib/readline/signals.c
	- add SIGHUP to the set of signals readline handles

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texi
	- document that SIGHUP is now part of the set of signals readline
	  handles

lib/readline/input.c
	- if _rl_caught_signal indicates that read() was interrupted by a
	  SIGHUP or SIGTERM, return READERR or EOF as appropriate
	- call rl_event_hook, if it's set, if call to read in rl_getc
	  returns -1/EINTR.  If rl_event_hook doesn't do anything, this
	  continues the loop as before.  This handles the other fatal
	  signals

execute_cmd.c
	- add a couple of QUIT; calls to execute_disk_command and
	  execute_simple_command to improve responsiveness to interrupts
	  and fatal signals

input.c
	- rearrange getc_with_restart so that the return values from read()
	  are handled right

parse.y
	- don't need to set terminate_immediately in yy_stream_get, since
	  getc_with_restart checks for terminating signals itself
	- since readline returns READERR on SIGHUP or SIGTERM, don't need
	  to set terminate_immediately.  Still doesn't handle other
	  signals well -- will have to check that some more

bashline.c
	- new function, bash_event_hook, for rl_event_hook.  Just checks for
	  terminating signals and acts on them using CHECK_TERMSIG.
	- set rl_event_hook to bash_event_hook

builtins/read.def
	- take out setting terminate_immediately; add calls to CHECK_TERMSIG
	  after read calls

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- move the text describing the effect of negative subscripts used to
	  reference indexed array elements to the paragraphs describing
	  ${parameter[subscript]}, since that's where they are implemented.
	  Pointed out by Christopher F. A. Johnson <cfajohnson@gmail.com>

arrayfunc.[ch],subst.c
	- array_expand_index now takes a new first argument: a SHELL_VAR *
	  of the array variable being subscripted.  Can be used later to fully
	  implement negative subscripts

				   3/14
				   ----
lib/glob/glob.c
	- fix mbskipname to not turn the directory entry name into a wide char
	  string if the conversion of the pattern to a wide char string fails
	- fix mbskipname to call skipname if either the pattern or the filename
	  can't be converted into a wide-char string

lib/glob/xmbsrtowcs.c
	- fix xdupmbstowcs2 to handle return value of 0 from mbsnrtowcs and
	  short-circuit with failure in that case.  Fixes bug reported by
	  Roman Rakus <rrakus@redhat.com>

				   3/15
				   ----
bashline.c
	- new variable, bash_filename_quote_characters to store the value
	  assigned to rl_filename_quote_characters so it can be restored
	  if changed.
	- change bashline_reset and attempt_shell_completion to restore
	  rl_filename_quote_characters if not set to default

				   3/22
				   ----
lib/glob/glob.c
	- wdequote_pathname falls back to udequote_pathname if xdupmbstowcs
	  fails to convert the pathname to a wide-character string

lib/glob/xmbsrtowcs.c
	- xdupmbstowcs2: change to fix problem with leading '\\' (results in
	  nms == 0, which causes it to short-circuit with failure right
	  away).  Fixes bug pointed out by Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>
	- xdupmbstowcs2: compensate for mbsnrtowcs returning 0 by taking the
	  next single-byte character and going on
	- xdupmbstowcs2: change memory allocation to increase by WSBUF_INC
	  bytes; try to avoid calls to realloc (even if they don't actually
	  result in more memory being allocated)

				   3/24
				   ----
doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- slightly modify BASH_SUBSHELL description based on complaint from
	  Sam Liddicott <sam@liddicott.com>

				   3/25
				   ----
trap.c
	- change free_trap_strings to not call free_trap_string for signals
	  that are being ignored, like reset_or_restore_signal_handlers.
	  Fixes bug reported by Satoshi Takahashi <blue3waters@gmail.com>

				   3/26
				   ----
lib/readline/rltypedefs.h
	- remove old Function/VFunction/CPFunction/CPPFunction typedefs as
	  suggested by Tom Tromey <tromey@redhat.com>

lib/readline/rlstdc.h
	- move defines for USE_VARARGS/PREFER_STDARG/PREFER_VARARGS from
	  config.h.in to here because declaration of rl_message in
	  readline.h uses the defines.  This makes it hard for another packages
	  to use after the header files are installed, since config.h is not
	  one of the installed files.  Suggested by Tom Tromey
	  <tromey@redhat.com>

				   3/27
				   ----
print_cmd.c
	- change indirection_string from a static buffer to a dynamic one
	  managed by indirection_level_string(), so we don't end up truncating
	  PS4.  Suggested by Dennis Williamson <dennistwilliamson@gmail.com>

lib/readline/shell.c
	- change sh_set_lines_and_columns to use static buffers instead of
	  allocating the buffers to pass to setenv/putenv

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- change _rl_get_screen_size to not call sh_set_lines_and_columns if
	  ignore_env == 0
	- _rl_sigwinch_resize_terminal: new function to just retrieve terminal
	  size, ignoring environment

lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- new external declaration for _rl_sigwinch_resize_terminal() (currently
	  unused)

lib/readline/signals.c
	- rl_sigwinch_handler: set _rl_caught_signal to SIGWINCH
	- rl_sigwinch_handler: don't immediately call rl_resize_terminal; just
	  leave _rl_caught_signal set for RL_CHECK_SIGNALS to handle
	- _rl_signal_handler: call rl_resize_terminal if sig == SIGWINCH.
	  Should fix hang when sending multiple repeated SIGWINCH reported by
	  Henning Bekel <h.bekel@googlemail.com>

				   3/29
				   ----
lib/sh/snprintf.c
	- include math.h for any defines for isinf/isnan
	- use code from gnulib documentation to implement isinf/isnan if they
	  are not defined

configure.in
	- don't check for isinf or isnan; c99 says they're macros anyway

config.h.in
	- remove defines for ISINF_IN_LIBC and ISNAN_IN_LIBC, no longer used
	  by snprintf.c

				    4/2
				    ---
braces.c
	- brace_gobbler: fix to understand double-quoted command substitution,
	  since the shell understands unquoted comsubs.  Fixes bug reported
	  by Michael Whitten <mfwitten@gmail.com>

lib/readline/display.c
	- include <pc.h> on MDOS
	- get and set screen size using DJGPP-specific calls on MSDOS
	- move cursor up clear screen using DJGPP-specific calls
	- don't call tputs on DJGPP; there is no good terminfo support

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- include <pc.h> on MDOS
	- get and set screen size using DJGPP-specific calls on MSDOS
	- use DJGPP-specific initialization on MSDOS, zeroing all the
	  _rl_term_* variables
	- don't call tputs on DJGPP; there is no good terminfo support
	  DJGPP support from Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@gnu.org>

config-top.h
	- change DEFAULT_PATH_VALUE to something more useful and modern

				    4/8
				    ---
tests/printf2.sub
	- make sure LC_ALL and LC_CTYPE are set so LANG assignment takes effect.
	  Reported by Cedric Arbogast <arbogast.cedric@gmail.com>

				   4/11
				   ----
include/chartypes.h
	- fix a couple of dicey defines (though ones that don't cause any
	  compiler warnings) in IN_CTYPE_DOMAIN

doc/{bashref.texi,bash.1}
	- add note referring to duplicating file descriptors in sections
	  describing redirecting stdout and stderr and appending to stdout
	  and stderr.  Suggested by Matthew Dinger <mdinger.bugzilla@gmail.com>

pcomplete.c
	- it_init_helptopics: new function to support completing on help topics,
	  not just builtins
	- it_helptopics: new programmable completion list of help topics
	- build list of helptopic completions in gen_action_completions on
	  demand

pcomplete.h
	- new extern declaration for it_helptopics

builtins/complete.def
	- the `helptopic' action now maps to CA_HELPTOPIC intead of CA_BUILTIN,
	  since there are more help topics than just builtins.  Suggested by
	  Clark Wang <dearvoid@gmail.com>

				   4/12
				   ----
print_cmd.c
	- fix print_arith_for_command to add a call to PRINT_DEFERRED_HEREDOCS
	  before ending the body of the command, so heredocs get attached to
	  the right command instead of to the loop.  From gentoo bug 363371
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=363371

execute_cmd.c
	- change coproc_pidchk to unset the appropriate shell variables when
	  the (currently single) known coproc pid terminates
	- cleanup and new functions to fully support multiple coprocesses when
	  and if I decide to go there

				   4/13
				   ----
print_cmd.c
	- fix print_group_command to add a call to PRINT_DEFERRED_HEREDOCS
	  after call to make_command_string_internal before printing closing
	  `}'
	- fix make_command_string_internal to add a call to
	  PRINT_DEFERRED_HEREDOCS after recursive call to
	  make_command_string_internal in case cm_subshell before printing
	  closing `)'

				   4/14
				   ----
print_cmd.c
	- change overlapping strcpy in named_function_string to memmove

sig.h
	- UNBLOCK_SIGNAL: convenience define, same as UNBLOCK_CHILD, just
	  restores an old signal mask

trap.c
	- set_signal: instead of setting the signal handler to SIG_IGN while
	  installing the new trap handler, block the signal and unblock it
	  after the new handler is installed.  Fixes bug reported by Roman
	  Rakus <rrakus@redhat.com>

				   4/15
				   ----
doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- make it clear that enabling monitor mode means that all jobs run in
	  separate process groups

				   4/18
				   ----
builtins/fc.def
	- update fix of 4/15/2010 to not take saved_command_line_count into
	  account when stepping down the history list to make sure that
	  last_hist indexes something that is valid.  Fixes bug reported by
	  <piuma@piumalab.org>

				   4/19
				   ----
builtins/fc.def
	- fc_gethnum: make sure the calculation to decide the last history
	  entry is exactly the same as fc_builtin.  Fixes bug uncovered by
	  fix of 4/18 to stop seg fault

				   4/22
				   ----
lib/readline/terminal.c
	- change _rl_enable_meta_key to set a flag indicating that it sent the
	  enable-meta sequence
	- _rl_disable_meta_key: new function to turn off meta mode after we
	  turned it on with _rl_enable_meta_key

lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- extern declaration for _rl_disable_meta_key

configure.in
	- if not cross-compiling, set CFLAGS_FOR_BUILD from any CFLAGS inherited
	  from the environment.  Fixes HP/UX build problem reported by
	  "Daniel Richard G." <skunk@iSKUNK.ORG>

				   4/26
				   ----
config-top.h
	- define MULTIPLE_COPROCS to 0 so the code is still disabled but easy
	  to enable via configure option or editing this file

				   4/29
				   ----
lib/sh/eaccess.c
	- freebsd provides faccessat, with the same misfeature as their eaccess
	  and access implementations (X_OK returns true for uid==0 regardless
	  of the actual file permissions), so reorganize code to check the
	  file permissions as with eaccess.  Report and fix from Johan Hattne
	  <johan.hattne@utsouthwestern.edu>

	  Expansion', suggested by Greg Wooledge <wooledg@eeg.ccf.org>

				    5/5
				    ---
pcomplib.c
	- the bash_completion project now distributes over 200 completions
	  for various programs, with no end in sight, so increase the value
	  of COMPLETE_HASH_BUCKETS from 32 to 128

pathexp.c
	- quote_string_for_globbing: make sure CTLESC quoting CTLESC is
	  translated into \<CTLESC> even if the flags include QGLOB_REGEXP.
	  We don't want to process the second CTLESC as a quote character.
	  Fixes bug reported by Shawn Bohrer <sbohrer@rgmadvisors.com>

				    5/6
				    ---
builtins/printf.def
	- change PRETURN to not call fflush if ferror(stdout) is true
	- if a call to one of the stdio functions or printstr leaves
	  ferror(stdout) true, and PRETURN is going to be called, let PRETURN
	  print the error message rather than doubling up the messages.  Fixes
	  problem reported by Roman Rakus <rrakus@redhat.com>

				    5/9

lib/readline/readline.c
	- _rl_internal_teardown: add call to _rl_disable_meta_key to make the
	  meta key active only for the duration of the call to readline()
	- _rl_internal_setup: move call to _rl_enable_meta_key here from
	  readline_initialize_everything so the meta key is active only for
	  the duration of the call to readline().  Suggestion from Miroslav
	  Lichvar <mlichvar@redhat.com>

builtins/help.def
	- help_builtin: change strncmp to strcmp so that `help read' no longer

config.h.in
	- add define for GLIBC21, checked using jm_GLIBC21 as part of the tests

lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- internal_free: don't use the cached value of memtop when deciding
	  whether or not to adjust the break and give memory back to the kernel
	  when using the GNU C library, since glibc uses sbrk for its own
	  internal purposes.  From Debian bug 614815, reported by Samuel
	  Thibault <samuel.thibault@gnu.org>

aclocal.m4
	- BASH_STRUCT_WEXITSTATUS_OFFSET: change AC_RUN_IFELSE to AC_TRY_RUN

				   5/14
				   ----
bashline.[ch]
	- two new functions, bashline_set_event_hook and bashline_reset_event_hook,
	  to set rl_event_hook to bash_event_hook and back to NULL, respectively
	- don't set rl_event_hook unconditionally

sig.c
	- termsig_sighandler: if the shell is currently interactive and
	  readline is active, call bashline_set_event_hook to cause
	  termsig_handler to be called via bash_event_hook when the shell
	  returns from the signal handler

lib/readline/display.c
	- _rl_col_width: Mac OS X has a bug in wcwidth: it does not return 0

	  <d.l.tDecontes@free.fr>

				   5/16
				   ----
lib/readline/rlmbutil.h
	- WCWIDTH: wrapper for wcwidth that returns 0 for Unicode combining

lib/readline/{complete,display,mbutil}.c
	- use WCWIDTH instead of wcwidth

				   5/17
				   ----
lib/readline/display.c
	- update_line: after computing ofd and nfd, see whether the next
	  character in ofd is a zero-width combining character.  If it is,
	  back ofd and nfd up one, so the base characters no longer compare
	  as equivalent.  Fixes problem reported by Keith Winstein

lib/readline/nls.c
	- _rl_utf8locale: new flag variable, set to non-zero if the current

	- rl_parse_and_bind: call _rl_skip_to_delim instead of using inline
	  code
	- rl_parse_and_bind: allow quoted strings as the values of string
	  variables.  Variable values without double quotes have trailing
	  whitespace removed (which still allows embedded whitespace, for
	  better or worse).  Fixes problem with string variables not matching
	  in `set' command if values happen to have trailing spaces or tabs

lib/readline/histexpand.c
	- history_expand: when processing a string within double quotes
	  (DQUOTE == 1), make the closing double quote inhibit history
	  expansion, as if the word were outside double quotes.  In effect,
	  we assume that the double quote is followed by a character in

	  lose their meaning within brackets
	- note that regular expression matching when the pattern is stored

redir.h
	- RX_SAVEFD: new flag value; notes that a redirection denotes an

	  a non-null string.  Fixes bug reported by Dan Douglas
	  <ormaaj@gmail.com>

bashline.c
	- attempt_shell_completion: mark that we're in a command position if
	  we're at the start of the line and the parser is ready to accept
	  a reserved word or command name.  Feature most recently suggested
	  by Peng Yu <pengyu.ut@gmail.com>

lib/readline/bind.c
	- _rl_escchar: return the character that would be backslash-escaped
	  to denote the control character passed as an argument ('\n' -> 'n')
	- _rl_isescape: return 1 if character passed is one that has a
	  backslash escape
	- _rl_untranslate_macro_value: new second argument: use_escapes, if
	  non-zero translate to backslash escapes where possible instead of
	  using straight \C-x for control character `x'.  Change callers
	- _rl_untranslate_macro_value: now global

lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- _rl_untranslate_macro_value: extern declaration

lib/readline/{macro.c,readline.h}
	- rl_print_last_kbd_macro: new bindable function, inspired by patch
	  from Mitchel Humpherys

lib/readline/funmap.c
	- print-last-kbd-macro: new bindable command, bound to
	  rl_print_last_kbd_macro

lib/readline/doc/{rluser.texi,readline.3},doc/bash.1
	- print-last-kbd-macro: document.

lib/readline/text.c
	- _rl_insert_next: if we're defining a macro, make sure the key gets
	  added to the macro text (should really audit calls to rl_read_key()
	  and make sure the right thing is happening for all of them)

bashline.[ch]
	- print_unix_command_map: new function, prints all bound commands in
	  cmd_xmap using rl_macro_dumper in a reusable format

builtins/bind.def
	- new -X option: print all keysequences bound to Unix commands using
	  print_unix_command_map.  Feature suggested by Dennis Williamson
	  (2/2011)

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- document new `bind -X' option

				   12/24
				   -----

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- add a couple of sentences to the description of the case modification
	  operators making it clearer that each character of parameter is
	  tested against the pattern, and that the pattern should only attempt
	  to match a single character.  Suggested by Bill Gradwohl
	  <bill@ycc.com>

				   12/28
				   -----
shell.c
	- init_noninteractive: instead of calling set_job_control(0) to
	  unconditionally turn off job control, turn on job control if
	  forced_interactive or jobs_m_flag is set
	- shell_initialize: call initialize_job_control with jobs_m_flag as
	  argument so `bash -m script' enables job control while running the
	  script

jobs.c
	- initialize_job_control: if the `force' argument is non-zero, turn on
	  job control even if the shell is not currently interactive
	  (interactive == 0)

				   12/29
				   -----

flags.h
	- new extern declaration for jobs_m_flag

builtins/{cd,set}.def,doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- added text clarifying the descriptions of cd -L and -P, suggested by
	  Padraig Brady <p@draigbrady.com>
	- slight change to the description of `set -P' about resolving symbolic
	  links

lib/readline/doc/rluser.texi
	- Added an example to the programmable completion section: _comp_cd,
	  a completion function for cd, with additional verbiage.  Text
	  includes a reference to the bash_completion project

				 1/1/2012
				 --------
jobs.c
	- set_job_status_and_cleanup: note that a job is stopped due to
	  SIGTSTP (any_tstped) if job_control is set; there's no need to
	  test interactive

				    1/5
				    ---
quit.h
	- LASTSIG(): new macro, expands to signal number of last terminating
	  signal received (terminating_signal or SIGINT)

trap.c
	- first_pending_trap: returns lowest signal number with a trap pending
	- trapped_signal_received: set to the last trapped signal the shell
	  received in trap_handler(); reset to 0 in run_pending_traps

builtins/read.def
	- read_builtin: changes to posix-mode (posixly_correct != 0) to make
	  `read' interruptible by a trapped signal.  After the trap runs,
	  read returns 128+sig and does not assign the partially-read line
	  to the named variable(s).  From an austin-group discussion started
	  by David Korn

				   1/11

lib/readline/{colors.[ch],parse-colors.[ch]}
	- new files, part of color infrastructure support

Makefile.in,lib/readline/Makefile.in
	- arrange to have colors.o and parse-colors.o added to readline
	  library

{configure,config.h}.in
	- check for stdbool.h, define HAVE_STDBOOL_H if found

lib/readline/bind.c
	- colored_stats: new bindable variable, enables using colors to
	  indicate file type when listing completions

lib/readline/complete.c
	- _rl_colored_stats: new variable, controlled by colored-stats bindable
	  variable
	- colored_stat_start, colored_stat_end: new functions to set and reset
	  the terminal color appropriately depending on the type of the
	  filename to be printed
	- print_filename: changes to print colors if `colored-stats' variable
	  set.  Changes contributed by Raphael Droz
	  <raphael.droz+floss@gmail.com>

lib/readline/readline.c
	- rl_initialize_everything: add call to _rl_parse_colors to parse
	  color values out of $LS_COLORS.  May have to add to rl_initialize
	  to make more dynamic if LS_COLORS changes (which doesn't happen
	  very often, if at all)

lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- _rl_colored_stats: new extern declaration

lib/readline/doc/{readline.3,rluser.texi},doc/bash.1
	- colored-stats: document new bindable readline variable

lib/readline/colors.c
	- _rl_print_color_indicator: call rl_filename_stat_hook before calling
	  lstat/stat so we can get color indicators for stuff like
	  $HOME/Applications

lib/readline/complete.c
	- stat_char: call rl_filename_stat_hook before calling lstat/stat

findcmd.[ch],execute_cmd.c
	- search_for_command: now takes a second `flags' argument; changed
	  header function prototype and callers
	- search_for_command: if (flags & 1), put the command found in $PATH
	  into the command hash table (previous default behavior)

execute_cmd.c
	- is_dirname: call search_for_command with flags argument of 0 so it
	  doesn't try to put something in the command hash table

bashline.c
	- bash_command_name_stat_hook: a hook function for readline's
	  filename_stat_hook that does $PATH searching the same way that
	  execute_cmd.c:execute_disk_command() does it, and rewrites the
	  passed filename if found.  Does not put names into command hash
	  table.  This allows command name completion to take advantage
	  of `visible-stats' and `colored-stats' settings.
	- executable_completion: new function, calls the directory completion
	  hook to expand the filename before calling executable_file or
	  executable_or_directory; change command_word_completion_function to
	  call executable_completion.  This allows $HOME/bin/[TAB] to do
	  command completion and display alternatives

pcomplete.c
	- gen_command_matches: now takes a new second argument: the command
	  name as deciphered by the programmable completion code and used
	  to look up the compspec; changed callers (gen_compspec_completions)
	- gen_shell_function_matches: now takes a new second argument: the
	  command that originally caused the completion function to be
	  invoked; changed callers (gen_compspec_completions))
	- build_arg_list: now takes a new second argument: the command name
	  corresponding to the current compspec; changed callers
	  (gen_command_matches, gen_shell_function_matches)
	- build_arg_list: now uses `cmd' argument to create $1 passed to
	  invoked command or shell function
	- gen_compspec_completions: if we skipped a null command at the
	  beginning of the line (e.g., for completing `>'), add a new word for
	  it at the beginning of the word list and increment nw and cw
	  appropriately.  This is all a partial fix for the shortcoming
	  pointed out by Sung Pae <sungpae@gmail.com>

	  key sequences.  Suggested by <rogerx.oss@gmail.com>.  Still needs
	  work to make a user-settable variable

parse.y
	- shell_getc: make code that uses the pop_alias dependent on ALIAS
	  define

variables.h
	- sv_tz: extern define should only depend on HAVE_TZSET

expr.c
	- expr_streval: if ARRAY_VARS is not defined, set lvalue->ind to -1;
	  move assignment to `ind' inside define
	- expr_bind_array_element: declaration and uses need to be #ifdef
	  ARRAY_VARS

arrayfunc.h
	- AV_ALLOWALL, AV_QUOTED, AV_USEIND: define to 0 if ARRAY_VARS not
	  defined; used in subst.c unconditionally

sig.h
	- make the signal blocking functions not dependent on JOB_CONTROL

sig.c
	- sigprocmask: make the replacement definition not dependent on

lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- _rl_free_undo_list: new extern declaration
	- _rl_keyseq_timeout: new extern declaration (see below)

lib/readline/misc.c
	- rl_clear_history: new function.  Clears the history list and frees
	  all associated data similar to history.c:clear_history(), but
	  takes rl_undo_list into account and frees and UNDO_LISTs saved as
	  `data' members of a history list entry

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texi
	- rl_clear_history: documented

lib/readline/readline.c
	- _rl_keyseq_timeout: new variable to hold intra-key timeout value
	  from 1/21 fix; specified in milliseconds.  Default value is 500
	- _rl_dispatch_subseq: change to use _rl_keyseq_timeout as intra-key
	  timeout if it's greater than 0; no timeout if <= 0
	- _rl_dispatch_subseq: don't check for queued keyboard input if we have
	  pushed or pending input, or if we're reading input from a macro

lib/readline/bind.c
	- keyseq-timeout: new bindable variable, shadows _rl_keyseq_timeout

	- sv_seqtimeout: new function to modify value of _rl_keyseq_timeout;
	  clamps negative values at 0 for now
	- _rl_get_string_variable_value: return value for keyseq-timeout

doc/bash.1,lib/readline/doc/{rluser.texi,readline.3}
	- keyseq-timeout: documented

lib/readline/isearch.c
	- _rl_isearch_dispatch: modification to fix from 7/18 to not use
	  cxt->keymap and cxt->okeymap, since by the time this code is
	  executed, they are equal.  Use `f' to check for rl_insert or
	  unbound func
	- _rl_isearch_dispatch: if we're switching keymaps, not in
	  callback mode, and don't have pending or pushed input, use
	  _rl_input_queued to resolve a potentially ambiguous key sequence.
	  Suggested by Roger Zauner <rogerx.oss@gmail.com>
	- _rl_isearch_dispatch: if we have changed keymaps and resolved to
	  an editing function (not self-insert), make sure we stuff the
	  right characters back onto the input after changing the keymap
	  back so the right editing function is executed after the search
	  is terminated.  Rest of fix for bug reported by Roger Zauner

builtins/gen-helpfiles.c
	- new file: reads struct builtin and writes the long docs to files
	  in the `helpdirs' subdirectory.  The filename is given in the
	  previously-unused `handle' member of the struct builtin.  Links
	  with `tmpbuiltins.o', which is created by Makefile to have the
	  right long documentation.  When not cross-compiling, gets the
	  right #defines based on configuration options from config.h instead
	  of trying to parse conditional parts of def files.  Fixes
	  shortcoming pointed out by Andreas Schwab <schwab@linux-m68k.org>

builtins/Makefile.in
	- tmpbuiltins.c: new generated file, created to enable creation of
	  separate helpfiles based on correct #defines instead of trying to
	  parse conditional parts of def files
	- gen-helpfiles: new program to generate helpfiles, links with
	  tmpbuiltins.o
	- HELPFILES_TARGET: new target, substituted by configure to `helpdoc'
	  if separate helpfiles requested
	- targets: new target, libbuiltins.a and $(HELPFILES_TARGET)
	- CREATED_OBJECTS: new variable, holds created object files for
	  make clean; changed make clean to remove created objects
	- helpdoc: changed to call gen-helpfiles instead of mkbuiltins

Makefile.in
	- when building libbuiltins.a, recursively call make with `targets'
	  argument to make sure separate helpfiles get built

configure.in
	- substitute `helpdoc' as value of HELPFILES_TARGET if
	  --enable-separate-helpfiles supplied as configure argument

builtins/mkbuiltins.c
	- `-nofunctions': new argument, causes mkbuiltins to not write value
	  for function implementing a particular builtin to struct builtin
	  and to write document file name to `handle' member of struct builtin
	- no longer writes separate helpfiles; that is left to gen-helpfiles

subst.c
	- make sure last_command_exit_value is set to a non-zero value before

	  instead of insisting on an indexed array

variable.h,subst.c
	- make_local_array_variable: changed prototype and caller

builtins/declare.def

subst.c

	  mtime/atime/ctime/etctime fields of struct stat are of type
	  struct timespec, and what the name is

include/stat-time.h
	- new file, cribbed from gnulib, with additions from coreutils: include
	  the right file to get the struct timespec define, or provide our own
	  replacement.  Provides a bunch of inline functions to turn the
	  appropriate members of struct stat into `struct timespec' values,
	  zeroing out the tv_nsec field if necessary

test.c

	- filecomp: call stat_mtime instead of sh_stat for each filename
	  argument to get the mtime as a struct timespec

	  builtin is executing, and only longjmp if interrupt_immediately is
	  set.  This whole set of fixes was prompted by report from
	  lanshun zhou <zls.sogou@gmail.com>

				   10/24
				   -----
lib/glob/glob.c
	- glob_filename: only check directory_name for globbing chars if
	  it's of non-zero length

lib/sh/strchrnul.c
	- new simpler implementation

subst.c
	- command_substitute: call set_shellopts after turning off errexit
	  in subshells so it's reflected in $SHELLOPTS

				   11/7
				   ----
builtins/evalstring.c
	- parse_and_execute: treat ERREXIT case like reader_loop does: set
	  variable_context to 0 before longjmping back to top_level. Don't
	  run the unwind-protect context to avoid side effects from popping
	  function contexts.  Part of fix for problem reported by Nikolai
	  Kondrashov <nikolai.kondrashov@redhat.com>

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_simple_command: call unlink_fifo_list only if this is the
	  last element of a pipeline (or not in a pipeline), rather than for
	  every child.  Fixes difference in behavior between /dev/fd and
	  FIFOs reported by Zev Weiss <zev@bewilderbeest.net>
	- execute_null_command: do the same thing in the parent branch after
	  make_child

				   11/14
				   -----
subst.c
	- parameter_brace_expand: a variable is null if it's special ($@, $*),
	  the expansion occurs within double quotes, and the expansion turns
	  into a quoted null.  Fixes debian bug 692447 reported by
	  Matrosov Dmitriy <sgf.dma@gmail.com>

jobs.c
	- run_sigchld_trap: make sure `running_trap' sentinel is set
	  appropriately
	- waitchld: only run the sigchld trap if we're not in a signal
	  handler, not running a trap, and executing the wait builtin.
	  Otherwise, queue for later handling.  We still run one instance
	  of the trap handler per exited child.  Bulk of fix for bug
	  reported by Elliott Forney <idfah@cs.colostate.edu>

trap.c
	- queue_sigchld_trap: set catch_flag so run_pending_traps notices,
	  and set trapped_signal_received for completeness.  Rest of fix
	  for bug reported by Elliott Forney <idfah@cs.colostate.edu>

lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- block_signals: renamed to _malloc_block_signals, made public
	- unblock_signals: renamed to _malloc_unblock_signals, made public

lib/malloc/imalloc.h
	- extern declarations for _malloc_{un,}block_signals

lib/malloc/table.c
	- mregister_alloc, mregister_free: block signals around table
	  manipulation

				   11/15
				   -----
trap.c
	- run_pending_traps: set SIG_INPROGRESS flag around calls to
	  run_sigchld_handler so other parts of the shell know that the
	  SIGCHLD trap handler is executing
	- run_pending_traps: if we get a situation where we are looking at
	  running a SIGCHLD trap but the trap string is IMPOSSIBLE_TRAP_HANDLER
	  and the SIG_INPROGRESS flag is set, just skip it.  This is possible
	  if run_pending_traps is called from a SIGCHLD trap handler run by
	  run_sigchld_trap

doc/bash.1,lib/readline/doc/{rluser.texi,readline.3}
	- corrected description of the effect of `set history-size 0'.  Report
	  from Vesa-Matti J Kari <vmkari@cc.helsinki.fi>

include/stdc.h

	- sv_histsize: if argument evaluates to a value < 0, unstifle the
	  history

				   11/22
				   -----
redir.c
	- do_redirection_internal: if we have REDIR_VARASSIGN set in the
	  redirection flags and we set up `redirector' using fcntl or dup2,
	  don't add a redirect to make sure it stays open.  Let the
	  script programmer manage the file handle.  Fixes bug reported by
	  Sam Liddicott <sam@liddicott.com>

				   11/24
				   -----
jobs.c
	- wait_for_any_job: new function, waits for an unspecified background
	  job to exit and returns its exit status.  Returns -1 on no background
	  jobs or no children or other errors.  Calls wait_for with new
	  sentinel value ANY_PID
	- wait_for: changes to handle argument of ANY_PID: don't look up or
	  try to modify the child struct, only go through the wait loop once.
	  Return -1 if waitpid returns no children

jobs.h
	- ANY_PID: new define

builtins/wait.def
	- new option: -n. Means to wait for the next job and return its exit
	  status.  Returns 127 if there are no background jobs (or no
	  children).  Feature most recently requested by Elliott Forney
	  <idfah@cs.colostate.edu>

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- document new `wait -n' option

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_command_internal: save make_command_string () result in a

	  make_command_string() result twice.  Fix from John E. Malmberg
	  <wb8tyw@qsl.net>

builtins/declare.def
	- declare_internal: if an array variable is declared using `declare -a'
	  or `declare -A', but not assigned a value, set the `invisible'
	  attribute so the variable does not show up as set.  Fix for bug
	  about variable initialization reported by Tim Friske <me@timfriske.com>

builtins/{mapfile,read}.def
	- after calling find_or_make_array_variable, make sure the invisible
	  flag is turned off, in case the variable was declared previously
	  using `declare -a' or `declare -A'.  Side effect of above change to
	  declare_internal

subst.c
	- shell_expand_word_list: handle the W_ASSNGLOBAL flag and put -g into
	  the list of options passed to make_internal_declare as appropriate.
	  Fix for bug reported by Tim Friske <me@timfriske.com>

				   11/30
				   -----
test.c
	- unary_op: make sure -v and -n check that the variable is not marked
	  as invisible before calling var_isset.  Fix for bug reported by Tim
	  Friske <me@timfriske.com>

				   12/2
				   ----
subst.c
	- process_substitute: turn off the `expanding_redir' flag, which
	  controls whether or not variables.c:find_variable_internal uses the
	  temporary environment to find variables.  We want to use the
	  temp environment, since we don't have to worry about order of
	  evaluation in a subshell.  Fixes bug reported by Andrey Borzenkov
	  <arvidjaar@gmail.com>

				   ----
lib/glob/glob.c
	- glob_filename: changes to avoid null filenames and multiple entries
	  returned for patterns like **/** (globstar enabled).  Fixes bug
	  reported by Ulf Magnusson <ulfalizer@gmail.com>

				   12/10
				   -----
lib/glob/glob.c
	- glob_filename: finish up a series of changes to make globstar-style	
	  globbing more efficient, avoid more duplicate filenames, and be more
	  compatible with other shells that implement it
		o collapse a sequence of **/**/** to one **
		o note when the directory name is all ** or ends in ** so we
		  can treat it specially when the filename is **
	  All inspired by report from Andrey Borzenkov <arvidjaar@gmail.com>

lib/sh/zread.c
	- zreadn: new function, like zread, but takes an additional argument
	  saying how many bytes to read into the local buffer.  Can be used to
	  implement `read -N' without so many one-byte calls to zreadc.  Code
	  from Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>

				   12/12
				   -----
lib/glob/sm_loop.c
	- PATSCAN (glob_patscan): if passed string already points to end of

	  extglob_skipname reported by Raphal Droz <raphael.droz@gmail.com>

				   12/13
				   -----
execute_cmd.c
	- execute_coproc: handle the command's exit status being inverted

	  Delete, and Insert keys.  Fix from Pierre Muller
	  <pierre.muller@ics-cnrs.unistra.fr>

builtins/printf.def
	- printf_builtin: '%()T' conversion: if there is no argument supplied,
	  behave as if -1 had been supplied (current time).  ksh93-like feature
	  suggested by Clark Wang <dearvoid@gmail.com>

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- document new printf %()T default argument behavior

lib/readline/display.c
	- displaying_prompt_first_line: new variable, indicates whether or
	  not the first line of output is displaying the prompt.  Always true
	  in normal mode, sometimes false in horizontal scrolling mode
	- rl_redisplay: set displaying_prompt_first_line to true unless we
	  are in horizontal mode; set to false in horizontal mode if the left
	  margin of the displayed line is greater than the end of the prompt
	  string
	- rl_redisplay: when in horizontal scroll mode, don't adjust
	  _rl_last_c_pos by the wrap offset unless the line is displaying
	  a prompt containing invisible chars
	- update line: don't adjust _rl_last_c_pos by the wrap offset unless
	  the line is displaying a prompt containing invisible chars
	- update_line: if shrinking the line by reducing the number of
	  displayed characters, but we have already moved the cursor to the
	  beginning of the line where the first difference starts, don't
	  try to delete characters

builtins/read.def
	- unbuffered_read: set to 2 if invoked as `read -N'
	- if unbuffered_read is set to 2, compute the number of chars we
	  need to read and read that many with zreadn.  Posix mode still
	  uses zreadintr.  Code from Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- read: make it clear that if read times out, it saves any input
	  read to that point into the variable arguments.  Report from
	  Fiedler Roman <Roman.Fiedler@ait.ac.at>

subst.c
	- command_substitute: change direct assignment of exit_immediately_on_error
	  to use change_flag ('e', FLAG_OFF) instead

flags.c
	- use errexit_flag as the variable modified by changes to the -e
	  option, reflect those changes to exit_immediately_on_error

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_builtin: new global variable, builtin_ignoring_errexit, set
	  to 0 by default and set to 1 if eval/source/command executing in a
	  context where -e should be ignored
	- execute_builtin: set exit_immediately_on_error to errextit_flag
	  after executing eval/source/command in a context where -e should
	  be ignored

flags.c
	- if builtin_ignoring_errexit is set, changes to errexit_flag are

				   12/24
				   -----
general.c
	- bash_tilde_expand: only set interrupt_immediately if there are no
	  signals trapped; we want to jump to top level if interrupted but
	  not run any trap commands

				   12/25
				   -----
jobs.c
	- run_sigchld_trap: no longer set interrupt_immediately before calling
	  parse_and_execute, even if this is no longer run in a signal handler
	  context

input.c
	- getc_with_restart: add call to QUIT instead of CHECK_TERMSIG

parse.y

parse.y
	- shell_input_line_{index,size,len}: now of type size_t; in some cases
	  the unsigned property makes a difference
	- STRING_SAVER: saved_line_{size,index} now of type size_t
	- shell_getc: don't allow shell_input_line to grow larger than SIZE_MAX;
	  lines longer than that are truncated until read sees a newline;
	  addresses theoretical buffer overflow described by Paul Eggert
	  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
	- set_line_mbstate: size_t changes like shell_getc
	- shell_getc: if shell_input_line is larger than 32K, free it and

variables.c
	- bind_global_variable: new function, binds value to a variable in
	  the global shell_variables table

variables.h
	- bind_global_variable: new extern declaration

builtins/declare.def
	- declare_internal: if -g given with name=value, but variable is not
	  found in the global variable table, make sure to call

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_builtin: since mapfile uses evalstring() to run its callbacks

	  expanding_redir to 1 (which bypasses the temp environment in the
	  variable lookup functions), call sv_ifs to reset the cached IFS-
	  related variables set by subst.c:setifs().  This ensures that
	  redirections will not get any IFS values that are set in the
	  temporary environment, as Posix specifies.  Then, after the word
	  expansions, after resetting expanding_redir to 0, call sv_ifs
	  again to make sure the cached IFS values are set from any
	  assignments in the temporary environment.  We force executing_builtin
	  to 1 to `fool' the variable lookup functions into using any temp
	  environment, then reset it to its old value after sv_ifs returns.
	  This is what allows read() to use the (cached) IFS variables set
	  in the temp environment. Fixes inconsistency reported by Dan Douglas

	- push_string: now doesn't attempt to call strlen on a NULL string to

	- parser_expanding_alias, parser_save_alias, parser_restore_alias: new
	  functions to provide an external interface to push_string and
	  pop_string; parser_save_alias sets flags element to PSH_SOURCE (could
	  be renamed PSH_EXTERN someday)
	- shell_getc: when yy_getc returns '\0', instead of just testing
	  whether the pushed_string_list is not-empty before popping it, don't
	  pop if if the saved string has flags PSH_SOURCE, indicating that
	  parse_and_execute set it before setting bash_input to the string.

	  back to a potential alias. Partial solution for the problem of aliases
	  with embedded newlines containing `.' commands being executed out of

	- _run_trap_internal: call {save,restore}_pipeline like in

	- run_pending_traps: since we no longer run traps in a signal handler
	  context, do not block and unblock the trapped signal while the
	  trap is executing
	- run_pending_traps: allow recursive invocations (basically, running
	  traps from a trap handler) with only a warning if the shell is
	  compiled in debug mode.  If a caller doesn't want this to happen,
	  it should test running_trap > 0. signal_in_progress (sig) only works
	  for the signals the shell handles specially

bashline.c
	- bash_event_hook: make sure we clean up readline if interrupt_state
	  is set, not only when SIGINT is not trapped.  check_signals_and_traps
	  will call check_signals, which calls QUIT, which will longjmp back
	  to top_level, running the interrupt trap along the way.  Fixes the
	  problem of signal handlers being reset out from under readline, and
	  not being set properly the next time readline is called, because

	- rl_clear_history, rl_free_keymap: add extern declarations.  Report
	  from Hiroo Hayashi <hiroo.hayashi@computer.org>

general.c
	- include trap.h for any_signals_trapped() prototype

lib/sh/unicode.c
	- include <stdio.h> for sprintf prototype

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_simple_command: only posix-mode shells should exit on an
	  assignment failure in the temporary environment preceding a special
	  builtin. This is what the documentation and code comments have
	  always said
	- execute_simple_command: make sure redirection errors, word expansion
	  errors, and assignment errors to Posix special builtins cause a
	  non-interactive posix mode shell to exit.  Previously the shell
	  would not exit if the failed special builtin was on the LHS of ||
	  or &&

pathexp.c
	- quote_string_for_globbing: when quoting a regular expression
	  (QGLOB_REGEXP), allow an unquoted backslash to pass through
	  unaltered. Don't use it as a quote character or quote it.  More
	  investigation from 1/24 and report by Mike Frysinger
	  <vapier@gentoo.org>
	- quote_string_for_globbing: when quoting a regular expression
	  (QGLOB_REGEXP), turn CTLESC CTLESC into CTLESC without adding a
	  backslash to quote it. We should not have to quote it because it is
	  not a character special to EREs. More investigation from 1/24

lib/glob/glob.c
	- glob_testdir: now takes a second flags argument (currently unused);
	  changed prototype and callers

				    2/1
				    ---
lib/glob/glob.c
	- glob_testdir: if flags argument includes GX_ALLDIRS (globstar), use
	  lstat so we skip symlinks when traversing the directory tree.
	  Originally reported by Chris Down <chris@chrisdown.name>

				    ---
lib/readline/undo.c
	- rl_do_undo: make sure CUR is non-zero before dereferencing it to
	  check cur->data against rl_undo_list.  Report and fix from
	  Andreas Schwab <schwab@linux-m68k.org>

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- added slight clarifying language to the description of $*,
	  describing what happens when the expansion is not within double
	  quotes

				    2/4
				    ---
test.c
	- unary_test: add code to -v case so that it interprets `bare' array
	  references (foo[1]) and returns true if that index has a value

				    2/5
				    ---
trap.c
	- restore_default_signal: fix SIGCHLD special case for SIG_TRAPPED flag
	  off but SIG_INPROGRESS mode set and handler IMPOSSIBLE_TRAP_HANDLER;
	  continue with resetting handler in this case. maybe_set_sigchld_trap
	  will check these things before resetting sigchld trap from
	  run_sigchld_trap.  Fixes (apparently long-standing?) problem reported
	  by Alexandru Damian <alexandru.damian@intel.com>

lib/sh/strtrans.c
	- ansic_quote: fixed a bug when copying a printable character that
	  consumes more than one byte; byte counter was not being incremented.
	  Bug report from jidanni@jidanni.org

				    2/7
				    ---
input.c
	- getc_with_restart: if read(2) returns -1/EINTR and interrupt_state or
	  terminating_signal is set (which means QUIT; will longjmp out of this
	  function), make sure the local buffer variables are zeroed out to
	  avoid reading past the end of the buffer on the next call.  Bug report
	  from Dan Jacobson <jidanni@jidanni.org>

				    2/9
				    ---
bashline.c
	- command_word_completion_function: if a directory in $PATH contains
	  quote characters, we need to quote them before passing the candidate
	  path to rl_filename_completion_function, which performs dequoting on
	  the pathname it's passed.  Fixes bug reported by Ilyushkin Nikita
	  <ilyushkeane@gmail.com>

				   2/11
				   ----
parse.y
	- xparse_dolparen: save and restore shell_eof_token around call to
	  parse_string, intead of just leaving it set to ')'
	- shell_getc: when -v is set, only print the command line when
	  shell_eof_token is 0, so we don't print it multiple times when
	  recursively entering the parser to parse $(...) commands.  Fixes
	  bug reported by Greg Wooledge <wooledg@eeg.ccf.org>

[changed release status to 4.3-release]

				   2/13
				   ----
lib/sh/strtrans.c
	- ansic_quote: handle case where mbrtowc reports that the multibyte
	  sequence is incomplete or invalid.  Fixes bug reported by
	  Eduardo A. Bustamante Lpez <dualbus@gmail.com>

				   2/14
				   ----
variables.c
	- find_variable_nameref_context: fix a problem that caused the loop
	  to go one context too close to the global context.  In some cases,
	  simple variable assignment would set a variable in the global
	  context instead of a local context.  Bug report from
	  Geir Hauge <geir.hauge@gmail.com>
