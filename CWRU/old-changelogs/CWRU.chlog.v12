				12/23/1996
				----------
[bash-2.0 released]

				   12/27
				   -----
configure.in
	- don't automatically use GNU malloc on FreeBSD, the builtin one
	  is supposed to be better (but doesn't have the debugging hooks)

builtins/exec.def
	- check that full_pathname(command) doesn't return NULL because of
	  inaccessible parent directories

support/config.sub
	- recognize OpenBSD

execute_cmd.c
	- broke the code that opens a file for output redirection when in
	  noclobber mode out into a separate function: noclobber_open().
	  This tries to avoid race conditions and file replacement between
	  stat(2) and open(2)

subst.c
	- make sure pat_subst does not run off the end of its return
	  string when copying the unmatched portion of the input string

				   12/30
				   -----
doc/Makefile.in
	- don't install readline.3 by default

lib/tilde/tilde.c
	- removed an unnecessary check for string[i] being non-null in
	  tilde_find_suffix

				   12/31
				   -----
support/config.{sub,guess}
	- merged in changes from config.sub in autoconf-2.12 distribution

lib/readline/readline.c
	- in rl_newline, only call _rl_vi_done_inserting and _rl_vi_reset_last
	  if readline is currently in vi mode

lib/readline/display.c
	- corrected a misuse of inv_lbreaks where vis_lbreaks was wanted in
	  the code that decides whether the cursor is at the beginning of
	  an otherwise-empty line

				 1/2/1997
				 --------
support/bashbug.sh
	- fixed a typo, thanks to eggert@twinsun.com

aclocal.m4
	- new test, BASH_STRUCT_DIRENT_D_FILENO, testing for d_fileno member
	  of struct dirent

configure.in
	- call BASH_STRUCT_DIRENT_D_FILENO

config.h.in
	- new #define for STRUCT_DIRENT_HAS_D_FILENO

lib/posixheaders/posixdir.h
	- only define d_fileno as d_ino if STRUCT_DIRENT_HAS_D_INO is defined
	  and STRUCT_DIRENT_HAS_D_FILENO is not defined.  This fixed the
	  problem of compiling getcwd.c on SunOS4.1.4 with cc

				    1/3
				    ---
lib/readline/complete.c
	- fix a memory-used-after-freed bug reported by Andreas Schwab

configure.in
	- call BASH_CHECK_SOCKLIB only if getpeername is not found in libc
	  (ac_cv_func_getpeername = no)

				   1/13
				   ----

builtins/getopt.h
	- change #define guard to _SH_GETOPT_H to avoid similar guards in
	  /usr/include/getopt.h (Dec OSF/1 4.x, for example)

variables.h
	- fix assign_array_from_string so that it rejects attempts to assign
	  to readonly variables

subst.c
	- fix verify_substring_values to handle offsets that are past the
	  end or before the beginning (in the case of a negative offset)
	  of the expanded variable value

				   1/14
				   ----
bashline.c
	- fix a problem where any completion after a `cmd` command
	  substitution would inappropriately attempt command completion,
	  even if the previous command substitution was correctly closed

builtins/evalstring.c
	- unwind_protect remember_on_history even if the shell is not
	  interactive, since history can now be used in scripts, and
	  `source' will turn off interactive_shell before calling
	  parse_and_execute

jobs.c
	- new function get_job_by_pid(pid, block) to translate a pid to
	  a job number.  The block argument says whether or not to block
	  SIGCHLD

jobs.h
	- new extern declaration for get_job_by_pid

builtins/jobs.def
	- call get_job_by_pid if an argument appears to be a pid rather
	  than a jobspec

configure.in
	- configure --without-gnu-malloc automatically on MachTen 4.x

builtins/cd.def
	- change to mindist() so that a best guess of `.' returns 3,
	  which means not reasonable

lib/posixheaders/memalloc.h
	- changed hpux_9 to __hpux, since the new config stuff doesn't
	  define hpux_9

subst.c
	- fix parameter_brace_patsub to handle null patterns (doesn't
	  do anything)

oslib.c
	- slight change to bzero replacement

support/bashbug.sh
	- changed TEMP to be /tmp/bbug.$$ as a sop to systems with 14-char
	  file names

doc/bashref.texi
	- add note to POSIX Mode section that the output of `set' when
	  invoked without arguments is sorted when in POSIX mode

				   1/15
				   ----
support/recho.c
	- a couple of changes prompted by a `gcc -Wall'

subst.c
	- changed ASSIGN_RETURN macro to use the do...while(0) idiom to
	  avoid problems with its multiple statements

builtins/setattr.def
	- a bad identifier given to readonly or export without an assignment
	  statement (e.g. `readonly a[5]') is an error, but not an assignment
	  error (i.e., return EXECUTION_FAILURE rather than EX_BADASSIGN)

tests/{{array,new-exp}.,tilde-}tests
	- added `set +o posix' at the beginning to disable POSIX mode, which
	  causes some of the tests to fail.  Some systems (e.g. LINUX-FT),
	  set POSIXLY_CORRECT by default

tests/test-tests
	- added a warning if $UID is 0 to the effect that the test suite
	  should not be run as root
	- worked around the `noread' and `nowrite' tests failing when run
	  as root

test.c
	- began removing the remains of the STANDALONE code, since test is
	  included in GNU shellutils

				   1/16
				   ----
lib/readline/{readline,display}.c
	- a couple of slight changes to build on Win95 using djgpp (reported
	  by x-aes@telelogic.se)

Makefile.in
	- changed TERMCAP_LIBDIR to TERM_LIBDIR, so building the termcap
	  library (if necessary) should work now

bashline.c
	- new function: quote_word_break_characters(), to backslash-quote 
	  characters in a filename that the readline completion code would
	  treat as word breaks
	- change bash_quote_filename to call quote_word_break_characters if
	  the completion quoting style says to use backslashes
	- add `:' to rl_filename_quote_characters, since it's part of
	  filename_word_break_characters

lib/posixheaders/posixjmp.h
	- new file, with half of bashjmp.h
	- posixjmp.h and lib/readline/posixjmp.h are symlinks to this file

bashjmp.h
	- include "posixjmp.h" for possible redefinitions of setjmp/longjmp
	  and procenv_t

				   1/17
				   ----
shell.c
	- bad options now cause the standard shell usage message (a subset
	  of what `bash --help' prints) to be displayed on stderr

trap.c
	- don't free the trap command for a DEBUG trap in
	  restore_default_signal if SIG_INPROGRESS is set -- there's already
	  a pointer saved to the old value in _run_trap_internal.  This
	  makes bashdb run better, too

examples/bashdb/bashdb.{pre,fns}
	- a couple of minor fixes; it actually has a chance of working now

				   1/21
				   ----
config.h.in
	- add a define for <dlfcn.h>, HAVE_DLFCN_H

configure.in
	- look for <dlfcn.h>, define HAVE_DLFCN_H if found

builtins/enable.def
	- include <dlfcn.h> only if HAVE_DLFCN_H is defined

lib/readline/display.c
	- renamed clear_to_eol to _rl_clear_to_eol and made it global, so
	  other library files (readline.c) can use it
	- new function _rl_clear_screen, to clear the screen with the right
	  termcap escape sequence

lib/readline/readline.c
	- call _rl_clear_to_eol and _rl_clear_screen instead of using tputs
	- extern declarations for _rl_clear_to_eol and _rl_clear_screen

				   1/22
				   ----
mailcheck.c
	- fixed a problem in make_default_mailpath() where a slash was not
	  added between the default mail directory and the username

				   1/23
				   ----
stringlib.c
	- added a fourth parameter to ansicstr: the length of the returned
	  string

externs.h
	- changed declaration of ansicstr

parse.y
	- changed call to ansicstr -- saves a call to strlen

builtins/echo.def
	- changed call to ansicstr
	- if do_v9 is non-zero, use putchar to output the string instead
	  of printf, since there may be embedded NULL characters

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}, builtins/trap.def
	- modified the `trap' documentation to make it clearer that trap
	  takes multiple signal specs as arguments

jobs.c, nojobs.c, jobs.h
	- renamed initialize_jobs to initialize_job_control, added an
	  argument (force)

jobs.c
	- set shell_tty to fileno(stderr) in initialize_job_control if
	  the shell is not interactive.  This fixes the problem of bad
	  tty pgrps when monitor mode is turned on in a non-interactive
	  shell

sig.c
	- made initialize_terminating_signals do only that; moved the rest
	  of the code that used to be there into a new function:
	  initialize_shell_signals, which calls initialize_terminating_signals
	  if the shell is interactive
	- initialize_terminating_signals is now extern
	- made reset_terminating_signals return immediately if
	  termsigs_intitialized is zero, meaning that
	  initialize_terminating_signals has not been called

sig.h
	- new extern declaration for initialize_terminating_signals

trap.c
	- call initialize_terminating_signals from set_signal if sig is
	  EXIT_TRAP and the shell is not interactive.  Since the terminating
	  signals do not need to be initialized until a trap on exit is
	  set, not doing that at startup should result in a speed increase
	  for scripts

execute_cmd.c
	- save and restore command->flags in time_command, so you can use
	  `time command' in a loop

				   1/24
				   ----
lib/readline/display.c
	- fix redisplay code to wrap correctly if the prompt is longer than
	  the screen width (reported by bos@Eng.Sun.COM)

lib/readline/undo.c
	- don't include <setjmp.h>, it's not needed

lib/readline/{util,readline}.c
	- include "posixjmp.h" instead of <setjmp.h>
	- readline_top_level is now a `procenv_t' instead of a `jmp_buf'
	  (now readline uses the correct posix semantics for preserving
	  the signal mask and other things across longjmp)

parse.y
	- fixes to push_string/pop_string to make them more general -- they
	  now can be used generally, instead of having to be associated
	  with an alias being expanded
	- fixes to the parser so that it parses (( ls abc; ls def); ls ghi)
	  as a nested subshell command for backwards compatibility.  Broke
	  the double-paren expression parsing off into a new function:
	  parse_arith_cmd, called from read_token when a `((' is seen.  If
	  it looks like an arithmetic command, return `let' and set things
	  up so that the expression is returned as a double-quoted string
	  by the next call to read_token.  If it's a nested subshell, push
	  the text we parsed onto the list of strings for later consumption
	  and return `('

lib/glob/glob.c
	- fix glob_vector so it doesn't short-circuit checking a filename if
	  it starts with a `.' and the pattern starts with `\.' (if
	  noglob_dot_filenames is set).  This makes `".junk2"*' match
	  `.junk2.txt' correctly

				   1/27
				   ----
support/bashbug.sh
	- ask for confirmation before sending the bug report

builtins/fc.def
	- when editing and re-executing a multiline command, make sure
	  current_command_line_count is initialized and then incremented
	  for each line read from the file so that the lines added to
	  the history list by fc_replhist and fc_addhist obey the `lithist'
	  and `cmdhist' shopt options.  Reported by tibbitts@pb.seflin.org

				   1/28
				   ----
lib/readline/readline.h
	- added a couple of extern declarations for variables described in
	  the documentation but heretofore undeclared

builtins/ulimit.def
	- try to catch some classes of integer overflows before calling
	  set_limit

				   1/29
				   ----
parse.y
	- push and pop a `(' delimiter while parsing a $(...) construct, so
	  the history code doesn't try to inappropriately add a `;' when
	  a newline appears in the `...'

aclocal.m4
	- new macro, BASH_STRUCT_WINSIZE, which looks for `struct winsize'
	  in <sys/ioctl.h> (or one of the files it includes)

configure.in
	- call BASH_STRUCT_WINSIZE
	- slightly reorganized the calls to bash-specific macros

config.h.in
	- add an `#undef STRUCT_WINSIZE_IN_SYS_IOCTL'

jobs.c, nojobs.c
	- only look in sys/ptem.h for struct winsize if
	  STRUCT_WINSIZE_IN_SYS_IOCTL is not defined to cpp

				   1/30
				   ----
.{distribution,patchlevel}
	- renamed to _{distribution,patchlevel}

configure.in
	- create a variable BASHVERS, from the contents of _distribution,
	  and a variable BASHPATCH, from the contents of _patchlevel,
	  (using m4 magic so we don't have to distribute .distribution
	  and .patchlevel) and substitute them into Makefile.in

Makefile.in
	- use Version and PatchLevel variables instead of the contents of
	  .distribution and .patchlevel, respectively.  These are set by
	  configure
	- removed `.machine' from targets and dependencies

support/mkversion.sh
	- new shell script to handle updating version.h, replaces mkversion.c
	  (which is now overkill)

support/mkdist
	- don't bother with writing .distribution and .patchlevel files,
	  since they're no longer distributed

support/mknewvers.sh
	- simple bash script to make new version files.  It can increment
	  the major or minor version numbers or patchlevel, or take a
	  completely new version number (e.g., 2.01) as an argument

doc/Makefile.in
	- added support for the `install-info' command to update the info
	  directory file after installing bash.info

				   1/31
				   ----
builtins/help.def
	- fix core dump with `help --'

susbt.c
	- make call_expand_word_internal obey the convention that if
	  expand_word_internal returns &expand_word_{fatal,error}, then
	  w->word has already been freed
	- return &expand_word_fatal from expand_word_internal if the shell
	  is not interactive and `set -u' has been executed

test.c, general.c
	- moved group_member from test.c to general.c

externs.h, general.h
	- moved extern declaration of group_member from externs.h to general.h

general.c
	- broke the code that initializes the group array out into a new
	  function, initialize_group_array()
	- initialize_group_array() now initializes an array even if the OS
	  does not have getgroups().  If it does not, an array with one
	  element (the real gid) is created
	- call sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX) if sysconf is available and
	  _SC_NGROUPS_MAX is defined
	- new function, char **get_group_list(int *), to return an array
	  of strings made from the groups list

variables.c
	- new dynamic array variable: GROUPS, expands to the group set as
	  obtained with getgroups() (or whatever initialize_group_array()
	  makes)

doc/{bash.{1,html},bashref.texi}
	- added description of GROUPS variable

test/test-tests
	- before modifying the setgid bit on /tmp/setgid, try to change its
	  group to ${GROUPS[0]} 

				    2/3
				    ---
aclocal.m4
	- new autconf macro, BASH_MISC_SPEED_T, to see if speed_t is defined
	  in <sys/types.h>

configure.in
	- call BASH_MISC_SPEED_T

config.h.in
	- add `#undef SPEED_T_IN_SYS_TYPES'

lib/readline/tcap.h
	- include `rltty.h' if HAVE_TERMCAP_H and __linux__ are defined, but
	  SPEED_T_IN_SYS_STYPES is not, before including <termcap.h>

support/mksignames.c, siglist.c
	- add support for 4.4 BSD SIGLOST

support/config.guess
	- add support for recognizing QNX based on `uname' output

Makefile.in
	- make sure recho and zecho are compiled with the same set of CC
	  options as the rest of the sources

lib/readline/bind.c
	- change calls to rl_generic_bind to cast the third argument to
	  (char *) where necessary

command.h
	- two new flags: CMD_AMPERSAND (currently unused), and CMD_STDIN_REDIR,
	  which means that this command should have its standard input
	  redirected from /dev/null if there are not any explicit redirections
	  to stdin

execute_cmd.c
	- a redirection of type r_inputa_direction is no longer added at the
	  beginning of the redirection chain for an async command;
	  CMD_STDIN_REDIR is set in the flags instead
	- new function: stdin_redirects: returns the number of redirections to
	  stdin in a chain of redirections
	- new functions: async_redirect_stdin() to open /dev/null and make it
	  file descriptor 0
	- changes to make CMD_STDIN_REDIR propagate to all of the necessary
	  functions (like execute_simple_command)
	- execute_disk command now takes the flags from simple_command rather
	  than just the CMD_NO_FORK flag as its last argument
	- various places after make_child is executed (in the child) check for
	  CMD_STDIN_REDIRECT (and no stdin redirections or piping) and call
	  async_redirect_stdin
	- stdin_redir is now global

eval.c
	- set stdin_redir to 0 just before calling execute_command so it
	  gets reset to a known value and doesn't persist across commands

				    2/4
				    ---
builtins/ulimit.def
	- add a stub function for ulimit(2) on systems without HAVE_RESOURCE
	  or HAVE_ULIMIT that just sets errno to EINVAL and returns -1 --
	  QNX is one such system

bashhist.c
	- pre_process_line needs to protect all occurrences of hist_verify
	  with #ifdef READLINE

builtins/shopt.def
	- hist_verify needs to be protected with #ifdef READLINE, not
	  #ifdef HISTORY

				    2/5
				    ---
support/config.{guess,sub}, configure.in
	- chages to better support the Harris Night Hawk

[many files]
	- changes for things pointed out by gcc -Wall

lib/glob/Makefile.in
	- make sure -DSHELL is included in CCFLAGS so that globbing is
	  interruptible

lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- extern declaration for botch: if botch is #defined, it should be
	  the name of a void function

configure.in,Makefile.in,builtins/Makefile.in,
lib/{glob,malloc,readline,tilde}/Makefile.in
	- add a LOCAL_DEFS variable, substituted from configure into the
	  various Makefiles.  It's set to -DSHELL, so that define gets
	  passed to all sub-makes without doing anything special

lib/readline/readline.c
	- change to rl_digit_loop to make it compatible with GNU emacs:
	  if a key bound to `universal-argument' is read after reading
	  some digits, it terminates the argument but is otherwise
	  ignored.  This is how people can insert repeated digits

doc/{bash.{1,html},readline.3}, lib/readline/doc/rluser.texinfo
	- changed description of `universal-argument' to describe how
	  to terminate a numeric argument

				    2/6
				    ---
jobs.c
	- changed kill_pid to diddle the job and process data structures
	  if we're sending SIGCONT to a stopped job with `kill' so that
	  the shell knows the job is running again.  ksh93 does this

				    2/7
				    ---
unwind_prot.c
	- changed bcopy to FASTCOPY

builtins/enable.def
	- changed pointer arithmetic in delete_builtin to just subtract
	  the head of the builtins list (shell_builtins) from a pointer
	  to the builtin to be deleted (b) to find its index in the list
	  on ANSI C systems

				   2/10
				   ----
lib/readline/bind.c
	- when using old-style keynames to bind to a new-style macro,
	  pass an array of type (unsigned char *) to rl_macro_bind

builtins/getopt.c
	- change sh_getopt to return EOF if nextchar is empty or NULL
	  and sh_optind is greater than argc.  This can happen if a
	  script mixes calls to `getopts' with calls to `shift'

				   2/11
				   ----
print_cmd.c
	- fixed make_command_string_internal so that commands with the
	  CMD_TIME_POSIX flag set print `time -p' instead of `time'
	- changed print_redirection_list so the here documents are
	  printed after all the other redirections, and followed by a
	  newline (rather than a possible semicolon)
	- added a new variable, was_heredoc, to avoid adding a semicolon
	  at the beginning of an empty line after printing the heredoc
	  ending delimiter

execute_cmd.c
	- don't put the gnu_argv_flags into the environment any more; it's
	  proven to be a bad idea

configure.in
	- set LOCAL_CFLAGS to `-DSunOS5' on Solaris 5.5[.x]

builtins/echo.def
	- only call fflush() after printing each word on SunOS 5.5, since
	  that's the system with the bug that prompted its inclusion in
	  the first place

support/mksignames.c
	- added support for more system-specific signals from AIX 4.2,
	  changed initialization order so that system-specific signals
	  are done first, before the common signals

				   2/12
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- broke the code that creates a file containing the text of a
	  here document out into a separate function: here_doc_to_fd
	- create the temp file used for a here document with mode 600
	- open the temp file used for a here document with O_EXCL

shell.h
	- changed the uid members of struct user_info to be of type uid_t
	  and the gid members to be of type gid_t

parse.y
	- changed the type of the `type' argument to init_yy_io() to be
	  `enum stream_type', since that's what's always passed

input.h
	- changed the function prototype for init_yy_io so the third arg is
	  type `enum stream_type'

externs.h
	- added a prototype for getcwd, if HAVE_GETCWD is not defined

builtins/umask.def
	- changed all variables that are used as arguments to or save the
	  return value from umask(2) to be of type mode_t
	- changed print_symbolic_umask to take an argument of type mode_t

				   2/13
				   ----
jobs.c
	- if old_sigint_handler is set to SIG_DFL, as it will be in a script
	  without a trap on SIGINT installed, call termination_unwind_protect()
	  directly from waitchld()

				   2/14
				   ----
configure.in
	- added a section before the call to BASH_CHECK_LIB_TERMCAP to
	  set a variable prefer_curses on some systems (AIX, for one)

aclocal.m4
	- in BASH_CHECK_LIB_TERMCAP, don't return -ltermcap if $prefer_curses
	  is non-empty

lib/readline/Makefile.in
	- redid the dependencies

				   2/17
				   ----
hashlib.c, getcwd.c
	- include `bashansi.h' instead of stdlib.h and string.h

error.c, siglist.c, xmalloc.c, builtins/{common,evalfile,mkbuiltins,psize}.c,
builtins/{exec,exit,fg_bg,hash,history}.def
	- include `bashtypes.h' instead of directly including <sys/types.h> 

builtins/fc.def
	- include ../bashtypes.h and ../posixstat.h instead of bashtypes.h
	  and posixstat.h

builtins/mkbuiltins.c
	- include ../posixstat.h instead of <sys/stat.h>

general.h
	- include `bashtypes.h' if RLIMTYPE is defined, so we can fetch
	  a definition of quad_t (or whatever) from <sys/types.h> before
	  using it in a function prototype

Makefile.in, builtins/Makefile.in
	- updated dependencies

				   2/18
				   ----
builtins/set.def
	- new function, set_posix_mode, called when `set [-+]o posix'
	  or `shopt -[su] -o posix' is executed.  It sets or unsets
	  $POSIXLY_CORRECT and calls sv_strict_posix

subst.c
	- in sv_strict_posix, call posix_readline_initialize only if
	  the shell is interactive (interactive_shell != 0)

shell.c
	- if we are acting like `sh', call posix_readline_initialize
	  if the shell is interactive
	- moved the code that does posix.2 mode initialization after
	  interactive_shell is set, and call posix_readline_initialize
	  if interactive_shell is non-zero

bashwait.h
	- renamed to unionwait.h, since that is what it defines

posixwait.h
	- moved the POSIX 1003.1 job control defines here from jobs.h

jobs.h
	- include `posixwait.h'

				   2/19
				   ----
braces.c
	- if SHELL is defined, pass the contents of new-style command
	  substitution through without expanding brace constructs between
	  the parens -- let the subshell do it

subst.c
	- when brace-expanding words, preserve the flags (word->flags) if
	  brace expansion does not change the word.  This fixes the problem
	  of things like

		 local -a avar=( ${PATH//: } );

bashline.c
	- have shell_expand_line pass a copy of rl_line_buffer to expand_string
	  in case there are substitution errors and the string gets freed

				   2/20
				   ----
expr.c
	- make sure that expland and explor set `lasttok' to LAND and LOR,
	  respectively, if they parse `&&' or `||'.  This makes the
	  precedence code work right

subst.c
	- changes so that non-interactive shells exit immediately when a
	  parameter that is unset is referenced after `set -u' has been
	  executed causes the shell to exit immediately

				   2/21
				   ----
flags.c
	- if `set -r' is executed, call maybe_make_restricted so that $PATH
	  and $SHELL are made read-only

execute_cmd.c
	- if `set -e' has been executed, and we're inverting a pipeline's
	  return status with `!', set CMD_IGNORE_RETURN so a failing
	  command does not inadvertently cause the shell to exit before
	  the exit status can be inverted.  This is probably only a problem
	  with the `eval' builtin.

				   2/24
				   ----
builtins/hash.def
	- add a missing argument of 0 to add_hashed_command

builtins/kill.def
	- job identifiers can be used in non-interactive shells as long as
	  job control has been turned on with `set -m'

jobs.c
	- we want to be notified of stopped jobs if job_control is non-zero,
	  even if the shell is not interactive

execute_cmd.c
	- make sure shell_execve returns EX_NOTFOUND if execve fails and
	  errno is set to ENOENT
	- makes sure execute_builtin saves the temporary environment to
	  builtin_env for the `eval' builtin, since it can destroy the
	  temporary environment when it calls parse_and_execute

bashhist.c
	- new variable: hist_last_line_added, set to 1 if the last command
	  line was added to the history successfully as a separate entry.
	  Used by `history' and `fc'

				   2/25
				   ----
trap.c
	- save line number before executing trap command, because
	  parse_and_execute resets it to 1 and the trap command might
	  want it

execute_cmd.c
	- change to executing_line_number to return trap_line_number if
	  the shell is currently running a trap

				   2/26
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- change to time_command so that a `real' value of 0 does not
	  cause a divide-by-zero error when computing cpu percentage

lib/readline/signals.c
	- if MUST_REINSTALL_SIGHANDLERS is defined, reinstall the SIGWINCH
	  handler in rl_handle_sigwinch

builtins/set.def
	- `unset' now rejects attempts to unset names that are not valid
	  shell identifiers as errors
	- add a description of `-o history' option to help text

subst.c
	- in parameter_brace_patsub, we want backslash removal done on
	  the replacement if (mflags & MATCH_QUOTED), since the code
	  in expand_word_internal will not do it.  We need to call
	  expand_string_unsplit directly, since maybe_expand_string does
	  not do the right thing

				   2/28
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- if execute_for_command finds that the iteration variable is readonly,
	  decrement loop_level before returning

builtins/break.def
	- if the break count is <= 0, display an error message and break out
	  of all loops

builtins/command.def
	- if PATH is unset, and we're using command -p, we don't want PATH
	  to be set to the empty string when `command' completes

builtins/common.c
	- POSIX.2 says `kill -l signum' prints the signal name without the
	  leading `SIG' prefix, so check for this_shell_builtin == kill_builtin
	  in display_signal_list

builtins/getopts.def
	- when invoked without any arguments, `getopts' now prints a usage
	  message

				    3/3
				    ---
builtins/common.c
	- add a second argument to get_numeric_arg: if non-zero, the shell
	  exits on a bad argument; if not, the shell jumps to top_level
	  with a DISCARD argument, which aborts the current command

builtins/{break,exit,history,return,shift}.def
	- change calls to get_numeric_argument

lib/readline/funmap.c
	- add `dump-macros' to list of bindable names

lib/readline/readline.h
	- added extern declaration for rl_prompt (it was apparently missing)

lib/readline/readline.c
	- new internal function, _rl_init_line_state, which sets rl_point
	  and rl_end to 0, sets the_line to point to _rl_line_buffer, and
	  clears the line

lib/readline/callback.c
	- if a user's callback function does not clear the line, clear it
	  for him by calling _rl_init_line_state

				    3/4
				    ---
alias.c
	- made the readline support functions #ifdef READLINE, so they're
	  not compiled into the shell unless readline is

lib/readline/bind.c
	- new function _rl_untranslate_macro_value, to expand meta-prefixes
	  and other special characters in a macro value for printing by
	  _rl_macro_dumper_internal
	- call _rl_untranslate_macro_value in _rl_macro_dumper_internal to
	  get a printable version of the macro value

lib/readline/readline.c
	- new variable, rl_dispatching, set to 1 when we call a function
	  from _rl_dispatch

lib/readline/readline.h
	- extern declaration for rl_dispatching

lib/readline/complete.c
	- make sure S_ISCHR and S_ISBLK are defined before using them

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- add a new #define NEED_EXTERN_PC.  Define this if the termcap
	  or curses libraries need `extern' before declarations of PC,
	  BC, and UP

lib/readline/{readline,terminal,histfile}.c
	- changes to compile on OS/2 with OS/2 `EMX' port of gcc, originally
	  sent by ilya@math.ohio-state.edu

builtins/set.def
	- fixed a bug in set_shellopts that caused the shell to crash if
	  there were no shell options set

				    3/5
				    ---
configure.in,Makefile.in
	- choose run-all or run-minimal as the test script based on whether
	  the --enable-minimal-config option was given to configure

builtins/setattr.def
	- fixed `export -p' and `readonly -p' so that they output `export'
	  or `readonly' when in POSIX mode, as POSIX.2 specifies

				    3/6
				    ---
builtins/setattr.def
	- make `readonly -a var=(...)' work just like `declare -ar var=(...)',
	  since the two logically mean the same
	- `readonly -f' and `export -f' don't print the function definition
	  for each readonly or exported function, respectively, when in
	  POSIX mode

jobs.c, nojobs.c
	- don't report status for processes killed by SIGPIPE if
	  DONT_REPORT_SIGPIPE is defined

config.h.top
	- added a commented-out define for DONT_REPORT_SIGPIPE

execute_cmd.c
	- `time' can now be used to time background pipelines, and reports
	  the timing statistics when the pipeline completes

[bash-2.01-alpha1 frozen]

				   3/12
				   ----
subst.c
	- move the parent end of the pipe file descriptor used for process
	  substitution to a high, unused file descriptor to avoid clashes
	  with redirections performed explicitly by a script

configure.in
	- added a `--with-curses' argument so curses can be forcibly chosen
	  over libtermcap (some Unix versions ship lousy termcap databases)

support/mkconffiles
	- new script to create _distribution and _patchlevel from values
	  contained in `configure'

doc/bashref.texi
	- updated installation instructions

				   3/13
				   ----
general.c
	- if `getgroups' returns 0, make sure we add the primary group id
	  as GROUPS[0].
	- if we have getgroups, and the primary gid is not in the array
	  getgroups returns, add it as group_array[0] and shuffle everything
	  up one element.  This ensures that current_user.gid == group_array[0]
	  all the time

tests/builtins.tests
	- changes to avoid stray variables in environment when the shell
	  version of printenv is used with bash as /bin/sh, running the
	  `exec -c' tests.

				   3/14
				   ----
builtins/cd.def
	- spelling correction is no longer enabled by default

support/bashbug.sh
	- if the shell's release status is alpha or beta, offer the option
	  of sending the bug report to the bash-testers mailing list as
	  well as to chet

				   3/17
				   ----
configure.in
	- configure --without-gnu-malloc by default on *-sgi-irix6* because
	  their code needs 8-byte alignment

support/bashbug.sh
	- ``' needs to be quoted with a backslash in double-quoted strings

aclocal.m4
	- slight changes to the strcoll test, since AIX 4.2 returns -1, 0, or
	  1 from strcmp(3) but a numeric collation order difference from
	  strcoll(3)

				   3/18
				   ----
command.h
	- new redirection error code:  HEREDOC_REDIRECT

execute_cmd.c
	- return HEREDOC_REDIRECT from do_redirection_internal when
	  here_document_to_fd cannot create the temp file for a here document
	- changed redirection_error to print a meaningful message when
	  here document temp file creation fails (HEREDOC_REDIRECT)

				   3/19
				   ----
subst.c
	- changes to match_pattern_char: return 1 if the first char of the
	  pattern is `?' only if the string is non-null; just return 1 if
	  the first char of the pattern is `[' and the string is non-empty
	  rather than try to re-implement the brace matching code from fnmatch

lib/glob/fnmatch.c
	- some changes from glibc-2.0.1 posix/fnmatch.c

				   3/21
				   ----
variables.c
	- only do the initialization of `ignoreeof' if the shell is
	  interactive
	- reset values of $SHLVL > 1000 to 1 in adjust_shell_level, and
	  don't call itos, since we don't need its generality
	- new function, initialize_shell_level, just calls adjust_shell_level
	  with argument of 1.  If $SHLVL is unset, adjust_shell_level will
	  deal with it correctly
	- change initialize_shell_variables to not malloc a copy of each
	  environment variable, just keep two pointers into the env string:
	  one for the name, one for the value
	- broke the code that computes the value of $BASH out into a separate
	  function: get_bash_name
	- get_bash_name special-cases shell_name with a `./' prefix when
	  initializing $BASH
	- new function: set_home_var, sets $HOME to current_user.home_dir if
	  it's not already set, calling get_current_user_info if
	  current_user.home_dir is NULL
	- new function: set_shell_var, sets $SHELL to current_user.shell if
	  it's not already set, calling get_current_user_info if
	  current_user.shell is NULL
	- changed places that reference information in current_user to check
	  for NULL values of the member they're interested in and call
	  get_current_user_info if necessary

shell.c
	- moved the code that sets up the information in current_user that
	  comes from the password file into a new function,
	  get_current_user_info
	- shell_initialize calls get_current_user_info only if the shell is
	  interactive

externs.h
	- new extern declaration for get_current_user_info(), so variables.c
	  can use it

				   3/24
				   ----
lib/tilde/tilde.c
	- if SHELL is defined, user the current_user struct info to find
	  the user's home directory rather than calling getpwuid

				   3/25
				   ----
nojobs.c
	- don't try to open /dev/tty when getting or setting the tty state
	  and window size; use shell_tty instead
	- initialize shell_tty to standard error in initialize_job_control
	- only fetch the tty state initially if the shell is interactive

general.c
	- open /dev/tty with the O_NONBLOCK flag

variables.c
	- changed all_vars so that it sorts its output all the time, not
	  just when in POSIX mode.  This means that the output of `set'
	  and `export' will be sorted

builtins/set.def
	- in initialize_shell_options, only call parse_shellopts if we
	  inherited $SHELLOPTS from the environment
	- make sure we call parse_shellopts from initialize_shell_options
	  with a copy of the value of SHELLOPTS, in case one of the functions
	  called while setting one of the variables modifies $SHELLOPTS

lib/readline/readline.c
	- make sure that digit arguments don't change the state of
	  rl_last_func

support/printenv.c
	- new file, printenv(1) clone, used to avoid environment variables
	  that might be set automatically when using printenv.sh

lib/tilde/tilde.c
	- if SHELL is defined, don't call getenv to get the value of $HOME,
	  call get_string_value () directly

				   3/26
				   ----
lib/readline/histexpand.c
	- abstracted the `#ifdef SHELL' stuff that checked for special cases
	  that should not be history expanded ([!...], ${!...}) into a call
	  to a function that is the value of the
	  new history_inhibit_expansion_function variable

lib/readline/history.h
	- extern declaration for history_inhibit_expansion_function

bashhist.c
	- new function, bash_history_inhibit_expansion, which checks for
	  the special cases in which history expansion should be inhibited
	- changes to the various history initialization functions to
	  set history_inhibit_expansion_function

lib/readline/doc/hstech.texinfo
	- documented history_inhibit_expansion_function

lib/readline/shell.c
	- new file, containing versions of the functions that are provided
	  by bash when readline is linked as part of bash
	- new function: get_env_value().  If SHELL is defined, this calls
	  get_string_value().  If SHELL is not defined, this calls getenv()

lib/readline/histexpand.c
	- moved single_quote() to shell.c

lib/readline/util.c
	- moved savestring() to shell.c

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- moved set_lines_and_columns() to shell.c

lib/readline/Makefile.in, Makefile.in
	- added shell.c and shell.o to the appropriate variables that contain
	  the files comprising the readline and history libraries

lib/readline/signals.c
	- introduced two new cpp defines:  HANDLE_JOB_SIGNALS and
	  HANDLE_SIGTERM.  When HANDLE_JOB_SIGNALS is defined, SIGTSTP,
	  SIGTTIN, and SIGTTOU are caught and handled.  When HANDLE_SIGTERM
	  is defined, SIGTERM is caught and handled.  These are both
	  defined automatically if SHELL is not defined

lib/readline/{bind,histfile,nls,readline,terminal}.c
	- call get_env_value instead of getenv().  This should remove the
	  dependency on being able to redefine getenv() in oslib.c

shell.c
	- added a missing argument of -1 to the call to list_minus_o_opts.
	  Now `bash -o' lists all options, not just random ones depending
	  on what's on the stack

				   3/28
				   ----
builtins/ulimit.def
	- change RLIM_INFINITY to the hard limit only if the hard limit is
	  greater than the current (soft) limit

hashlib.c
	- return immediately from flush_hash_table if the hash table passed
	  is NULL

				    4/1
				    ---
shell.c
	- remove call to initialize_filename_hashing -- initialize the hash
	  table the first time a hashed command has to be remembered

hashcmd.c
	- new file, with functions to perform filename hashing and lookup
	  taken from builtins/hash.def and builtins/common.c
	- change to remember_filename -- call initialize_filename_hashing
	  if hashing_initialized is 0

hashcmd.h
	- new file, mostly from builtins/hashcom.h, with extern function
	  declarations added

execute_cmd.c, builtins/{hash,type}.def
	- include hashcmd.h for hash function and type definitions

builtins/{common.{c,h},hash.def}
	- moved hashing functions and declarations to hashcmd.c/hashcmd.h

Makefile.in, builtins/Makefile.in
	- changed source and object file definitions and dependencies because
	  of addition of hashcmd.h and hashcmd.c

builtins/hash.def
	- return immediately from print_hashed_commands if hashed_commands
	  is empty, indicating that the hash table has not been initialized

				    4/2
				    ---
lib/readline/bind.c
	- fixed translation of ESC in rl_untranslate_keyseq and
	  rl_untranslate_macro_value

lib/readline/{readline,kill}.c
	- added an argument to _rl_fix_point telling it whether or not to
	  fix up the mark also; changed calls to _rl_fix_point to add the
	  appropriate argument

Makefile.in
	- changed the substitution delimiter in the `sed' commands that
	  create bashbug from `:' to `%' to avoid conflicts with options
	  containing `:'

				    4/3
				    ---
print_cmd.c
	- made the initial value and the default growth value for the
	  printed command somewhat smaller -- we don't really need to
	  allocate 4096 bytes for the printed command
	- added stdarg support to xprintf if PREFER_STDARG is defined

stringlib.c
	- changed strip_trailing to take the index of the last character
	  as the second argument, saving a (useless) call to strlen, since
	  the caller already knows where the end of the string is

subst.c
	- change call to strip_trailing in command_substitute to add the
	  new second argument

externs.h
	- changed extern declaration for strip_trailing

				    4/4
				    ---
Makefile.in, configure.in, lib/malloc/Makefile.in
	- changed the strategy for picking which `malloc' to include by
	  having configure define a `malloc target' and the Makefile in
	  lib/malloc implementing rules for that target

				    4/5
				    ---
Makefile.in
	- slightly changed the rules for remaking `parser-built':  it is
	  now a copy of y.tab.h, updated only when the contents of y.tab.h
	  change
	- everything that used to depend on y.tab.h now depends on
	  parser-built

				    4/6
				    ---
execute_cmd.c, print_cmd.c
	- use #include <y.tab.h> so we pick up y.tab.h from the build
	  directory instead of the source directory if it happens to be
	  recreated in the build directory

				    4/7
				    ---
bashline.c
	- fixed another problem with `pwd`/[TAB] thinking that the `/
	  started an unclosed command substitution, generating errors

				    4/8
				    ---
general.c
	- renamed bash_tilde_expansion_failure_hook to be
	  bash_special_tilde_expansions, since that more accurately reflects
	  its function
	- changed tilde_initialize so that there is no failure hook -- the
	  special expansions are handled first with the preexpansion hook

lib/tilde/tilde.c
	- new variable: tilde_expansion_preexpansion_hook -- if non-null, it
	  points to a function that is called before standard tilde expansion
	  is attempted

lib/tilde/tilde.h
	- extern declaration for tilde_expansion_preexpansion_hook

doc/{bash.{1,html},bashref.texi}
	- added optional open paren to description of `case' command syntax

				    4/9
				    ---
variables.c
	- on qnx, set and export a variable `NODE' which contains the QNX
	  `node id'

general.c
	- QNX system can now handle pathnames with a leading `//'

configure.in
	- added `-Dqnx' to LOCAL_CFLAGS on QNX machines

lib/malloc/getpagesize.h
	- some systems need sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE) to obtain the page size;
	  added code to check for it

				   4/10
				   ----
print_cmd.c
	- include the prototype for cprintf only if PREFER_STDARG is defined,
	  otherwise just have a K&R-style forward function declaration

hashlib.h
	- reduced the default number of buckets in a hash table to 53

lib/tilde/tilde.c
	- prime the result string in tilde_expand by allocating a new string
	  that's as long as the input string (+16 if a tilde appears in
	  the string to be expanded).  This should reduce the number of
	  reallocs

subst.c
	- broke the code that reads the output of a command substitution
	  through the pipe to the subshell out into a separate function:
	  read_comsub().  This does not use stdio, but rather reads
	  directly from the pipe into a local 128-character buffer

				   4/11
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- some systems need both <sys/time.h> and <time.h>, so include both
	  if it's possible, otherwise include <sys/time.h> (if present)

lib/readline/rl{tty,defs}.h
	- moved includes of <sys/stream.h>, <sys/ptem.h>, etc. to rltty.h

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- include rltty.h after rldefs.h

variables.c
	- changes to make environment creation faster and use less memory
	  (fewer malloc/free calls, too):

		o two new variables: export_env_index (how many environment
		  strings are in export_env) and export_env_size (the
		  number of slots for strings allocated in export_env)
		o added new function add_to_export_env, since adding the
		  exported shell variables and shell functions does not
		  need to search the export_env for a definition to supersede
		  (we just cleared it out!)
		o renamed add_or_supersede to add_or_supersede_exported_var,
		  since it always works on export_env, and changed the second
		  argument to a flag saying whether or not to allocate a new
		  copy of the string placed into the environment
		o changed calls to add_or_supersede to the new
		  add_or_supersede_exported_var with the appropriate flags
		o don't free and reallocate export_env in maybe_make_export_env,
		  just free the strings and start anew
		o prime the size of export_env from the total number of shell
		  variables and shell functions -- this will always be enough
		  for the exported shell functions and variables, and big
		  enough most of the time for the entire environment

builtins/cd.def
	- efficiency hack in bindpwd():  if PWD is exported, we will have to
	  rebuild the entire exported environment after every time we change
	  directories.  What we do is see if array_needs_making changes value
	  from 0 to 1 after bind_variable ("PWD", dirname) is called, and
	  that PWD is exported.  If that happens, we just replace the value
	  of PWD in the exported environment with a call to
	  add_or_supersede_exported_var

bashline.c, parse.y
	- check calls to pre_process_line to make a fresh copy of the line
	  if pre_process_line returns what it was passed, in preparation
	  for future changes

bashhist.c
	- pre_process_line now returns its argument if it did not make
	  any changes to it

alias.c
	- free the bucket entry holding the alias to be removed in
	  remove_alias, as well as the data

				   4/14
				   ----
unwind_prot.c
	- if an unwind-protect frame is being discarded, and its cleanup
	  function is `restore_variable', the `arg' member points to a
	  SAVED_VAR that must be freed.  This change is made in
	  remove_unwind_protect_internal and unwind_frame_discard_internal

parse.y
	- need to free memory allocated by parse_arith_cmd if it is an
	  arithmetic command, after using it to make a new word

subst.c
	- fixed some memory leaks caused by not freeing the argument to
	  make_bare_word, which duplicates its string argument
	- need to dispose list generated by list_rest_of_args in
	  paramter_list_remove_pattern
	- make sure the return value from getpattern() is freed
	- make sure array_value_internal always returns newly-allocated
	  memory
	- get_var_and_type returns a new type: VT_ARRAYMEMBER if the
	  string passed is of the form var[index]
	- make sure parameter_brace_substring frees the memory allocated
	  by get_var_and_type if verify_substring_values returns 0

hashlib.c, hashlib.h
	- new function, dispose_hash_table (table), which frees the
	  table's bucket array and the table itself

alias.c
	- call dispose_hash_table from delete_all_aliases instead of just
	  freeing the table

pathexp.c
	- make sure to free `newnames' (but *not* its contents) before
	  returning from ignore_globbed_names

builtins/exec.def
	- make sure the argv created to pass to shell_execve is freed if
	  the execve fails and we're not exiting on failed execs

expr.c
	- broke evalexp into two functions: evalexp, which sets up the
	  jmp_buf that errors jump to, and subexpr, which does the
	  evaluation and pushing and popping of contexts
	- readtok now calls subexpr to evaluate subexpressions in
	  parentheses
	- evalexp now takes an additional paramter, a pointer to an int.
	  If the expression contains errors, the location to which this
	  points gets 0, otherwise it gets 1 to show that the value
	  returned may be used.  This plugs up memory leaks that were
	  the result of evalexp() longjmping back to top_level
	- fixed a memory leak: expr_stack[0] was not being freed

externs.h
	- changed extern declaration for evalexp

variables.c, subst.c, builtins/let.def
	- changed calls to evalexp appropriately.  They either cause a
	  longjmp (top_level, DISCARD) (which is what the old stuff in
	  expr.c did) or are handled by returning an appropriate error
	  value (e.g., &expand_word_error in subst.c)

				   4/16
				   ----
shell.c
	- make sure to free dollar_vars[0] before assigning it the first
	  argument following `-c command'

variables.c
	- if unsetting a local variable with a previous context, make sure	
	  to free the hash table element used to store the local variable

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- rearrange the includes so <sys/ioctl.h> is included before rltty.h,
	  as it is in rltty.c

				   4/17
				   ----
flags.c
	- new function: reset_shell_flags, which resets all of the flags
	  back to their initial values

flags.h
	- extern declaration for reset_shell_flags

builtins/set.def
	- new function: reset_shell_options, which resets all of the -o
	  options that are not also shell flags back to their initial values

builtins/shopt.def
	- new function: reset_shopt_options, which resets all of the shopt
	  options that are not also shell flags or -o options back to their
	  initial values

builtins/common.h
	- extern declarations for reset_shell_options and reset_shopt_options

execute_cmd.c
	- broke the code that reinitializes things when an executable script
	  without a leading `#!' is found out into a new function:
	  initialize_subshell
	- initialize_subshell now calls the reset_* functions that reset the
	  shell flags and options

general.c, general.h
	- move_to_high_fd now takes a third argument: the highest fd at which
	  to start looking.  If that's less than 20, the maximum number of
	  open files as returned by getdtablesize() is used (which is what
	  it did before this)

jobs.c, shell.c, subst.c
	- changed calls to move_to_high_fd appropriately

[bash-2.01-beta1 frozen]

general.c
	- itos now uses a local char buffer to do its conversion, but still
	  returns newly-allocated memory

				   4/21
				   ----
variables.c
	- be a little more careful when checking for backwards-compatibility
	  with exported function definitions

				   4/22
				   ----
builtins/ulimit.def
	- translate RLIM_INFINITY to limit.rlim_max if the current limit is
	  less than or equal to the hard limit, not just strictly less than
	  (the change of 3/28 was too drastic)

				   4/23
				   ----
oslib.c
	- fixed definition of to_lower on machines without strcasecmp

trap.c
	- don't free the trap command in change_signal if the SIG_INPROGRESS
	  is set in the signal's flags -- it will cause memory to be freed
	  twice if a trap command resets the signal handler more than once,
	  and _run_trap_internal keeps a pointer to the trap command so it
	  can free it, so there will be no leaks

				   4/24
				   ----
aclocal.m4,configure.in
	- removed BASH_CC_WORKS, since AC_PROG_CC now has the functionality

shell.c, externs.h
	- get_current_user_info is now a void function

bashline.c
	- alias_expand_line_internal was removed
	- new function, alias_expand_line, performs alias expansion on
	  rl_line_buffer and either replaces rl_line_buffer or signals
	  an error
	- new bindable commands: alias-expand-line and
	  history-and-alias-expand-line, available if ALIAS is defined

				   4/25
				   ----
Makefile.in, lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- changed the define that turns on malloc range checking from
	  `rcheck' to `RCHECK'

lib/readline/isearch.c
	- fixed a couple of places where rl_search_history would try to
	  free a NULL pointer

				   4/29
				   ----
unwind_prot.c
	- fixed a problem with saving a variable that is a null pointer
	  in unwind_protect_var.  It happens only on machines where the
	  size of a pointer is not the size of an int.  The old FASTCOPY
	  code would copy the eight bytes at memory location zero, which
	  did not necessarily make a null pointer

				   4/30
				   ----
shell.c
	- run_startup_files should turn off job control, since the startup
	  files should be run without job control enabled -- this makes
	  SIGINT interrupt startup file execution again
	- if we get a SIGINT or other longjmp to top_level while executing
	  the startup files, re-enable job control for interactive shells
	  before setting locally_skip_execution

				    5/2
				    ---
lib/readline/nls.c
	- if we have setlocale(3), don't bother with checking the
	  environment variables for valid values; just use setlocale()
	  to set the locale categories from the environment variables
	  directly and go into eight-bit mode if the current locale is
	  not C or POSIX

				    5/5
				    ---
sig.c
	- make sure that the handler for SIGPROF is not changed if it has
	  been set to something other than SIG_IGN or SIG_DFL -- this makes
	  profiling work after the terminating signals have been initialized

bashline.c
	- if a filename containing `!' is completed, and the user has started
	  the string with a `"', change the completion style to backslash-	
	  quoting, since there's no way to use `!' with double quotes (this
	  requires more changes to readline to really work right)

				    5/6
				    ---
lib/readline/complete.c
	- changes to make_quoted_replacement, insert_all_matches, and
	  insert_match and their callers to allow the application-specific
	  filename quoting function to change the quote character (e.g., for
	  bash to change a filename containing a `!' and started with a
	  double quote by the user into a filename with the `!' quoted by
	  a backslas and no double quote)

				    5/8
				    ---
jobs.c
	- new function: nohup_all_jobs(), calls nohup_job for each entry in
	  the jobs list
	- delete_all_jobs is now global

jobs.h
	- new extern declarations for delete_all_jobs() and nohup_all_jobs()

builtins/jobs.def
	- `disown' without any jobspec arguments means the current job.  Fix
	  a core dump printing the error message when there is no current job

				   5/12
				   ----
subst.c
	- process an expansion like $((foo); bar) as a command substitution,
	  not as an arithmetic expansion.  An arithmetic expansion must have
	  a closing `))'

				   5/14
				   ----
builtins/evalstring.c
	- the third argument to parse_and_execute() is now a flags word.
	  The caller can control the value of `interactive' and whether
	  or not history is disabled while parse_and_execute() runs

builtins/common.h
	- new #defines for the flag values for parse_and_execute()

{bashline,jobs,shell,subst,trap,variables}.c, parse.y, builtins/evalfile.c,
builtins/{eval,fc}.def
	- changed calls to parse_and_execute appropriately

builtins/evalfile.c
	- if _evalfile() is passed FEVAL_HISTORY as part of the flags arg,
	  don't pass SEVAL_NOHIST to parse_and_execute
	- new function: fc_execute_file, which sets FEVAL_HISTORY in the
	  flags argument to _evalfile()

bashline.c
	- call bash_add_history instead of add_history from
	  vi_edit_and_execute_command so the bash state variables get
	  updated properly.  This keeps the `v' command from operating
	  on an empty command when the history list is stifled

bashhist.c
	- bash_add_history is now global

bashhist.h
	- extern declaration for bash_add_history

builtins/fc.def
	- call fc_execute_file instead of maybe_execute_file in the
	  edit-and-re-execute case (fc -e ...)
	- don't manually insert the commands from the file created by `fc -e'
	  into the history list, just set remember_on_history and let
	  fc_execute_file take care of telling parse_and_execute to do the
	  right thing.  This makes compound commands and the `cmdhist'
	  and `lithist' settings work better.  This supersedes the fix of
	  1/27.  This was reported again by rchen@fractal.eng.yale.edu.

parse.y
	- the body of a `for' command (the commands between do...done or
	  {...}) should be a `compound_list' instead of a `list'.  Problem
	  reported by cpg@research.bell-labs.com

				   5/19
				   ----
lib/readline/complete.c
	- in filename_completion_function, if we find that the directory
	  pointer (return value from opendir(3)), is not null when state
	  is 0 (indicating that this is the first time the completion
	  function has been called for the current completion), call
	  closedir on it, assuming that it was left open by a previous
	  (interrupted) completion

	  English

tests/run-func
	- add a warning about exported functions in the environment

builtins/hash.def
	- if one of the arguments passed to `hash' is an absolute pathname,
	  just continue the loop, don't do list=list->next first.  This
	  fixes the `hash a/b' -> core dump bug

				   5/30

bashline.c
	- fixed a memory leak in command_word_completion_function, courtesy
	  of a.pfaller@pop.gun.de

hashcmd.c
	- fixed find_hashed_filename to always return a newly-allocated
	  string

execute_cmd.c
	- since find_hashed_filename returns newly-allocated memory, don't
	  call savestring() on it, and free it if the data is stale (in
	  search_for_command()).  Another memory leak fixed courtesy of
	  a.pfaller@pop.gun.de

lib/readline/histfile.c
	- open the history file for writing with mode 0600 for better

	  [in bash-2.01.1]

execute_cmd.c
	- select_query now uses legal_number to decide whether the user's

	  invalid input is entered
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

builtins/evalstring.c
	- fix to parse_and_execute so `bash -c 'time [-p] zzz'' works right

execute_cmd.c
	- fix to execute_command_internal so that `bash -c time [-p] (zzz)''

	  [in bash-2.01.1]
	- print_formatted_time should pass a long as the fourth parameter
	  to mkfmt 
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

externs.h, shell.c
	- `exit_shell' is now a void function

hashlib.c
	- print_table_stats is now a void function

mailcheck.c
	- made add_mail_file check for the filename in the mail file list
	  using the expanded filename, since that is what it puts into
	  the list
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

variables.c
	- for the time being, PWD will be auto-exported, since some systems
	  seem to expect it

doc/bashref.texi, lib/readline/doc/{hist,rlman}.texinfo
	- added necessary `dircategory' and `direntry' commands to make
	  `install-info' work correctly

Makefile.in
	- move $(LDFLAGS) after $(BUILTINS_LDFLAGS) and $(LIBRARY_LDFLAGS) on
	  the line that links bash

doc/texinfo.tex
	- upgraded to version 2.185 from the texinfo-3.9 distribution

lib/tilde/tilde.c
	- fixed a bug in tilde_expand so that enough space is allocated for
	  the string and terminating null byte if a `~' does not appear.
	  This was masked before by the bash malloc()
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

aclocal.m4
	- new test, BASH_TYPE_INT32_T, to check which builtin C type is
	  32 bits wide
	- new test, BASH_TYPE_PTRDIFF_T, to check which builtin C type is
	  appropriate for pointer arithmetic

configure.in
	- check sizes of int and long, and for the existence of an int32_t
	  basic system type.  Call BASH_TYPE_INT32_T if int32_t is not
	  defined anywhere in the system header files
	- check size of (char *), and for the existence of a ptrdiff_t
	  basic system type.  Call BASH_TYPE_PTRDIFF_T if ptrdiff_t is not
	  defined anywhere in the system header files
	- added a check for <stddef.h>

config.h.in
	- add lines for SIZEOF_INT, SIZEOF_LONG, SIZEOF_CHAR_P, int32_t,
	  u_int32_t, and ptrdiff_t
	- added line for HAVE_STDDEF_H

lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- new version, with many changes and much better memory usage; old
	  (bash-2.01) version is lib/malloc/omalloc.c

lib/malloc/gmalloc.c
	- new version, with a number of changes and range checking included
	  by default; old (bash-2.01) version is lib/malloc/ogmalloc.c

execute_cmd.c
	- applied patch from 5/27 to make execute_simple_command fork early
	  if it's part of a pipeline.  This keeps assignment statements or
	  other commands that don't require a builtin, function, or disk
	  command to be executed from modifying the shell's environment

tests/exec?.sub
	- renamed from tests/execscript.sub? because those filenames are
	  too long for System V 14-char filename systems

	  collating symbols, equivalence classes), full support for
	  strcoll(3), and case-insensitive pattern matching

lib/glob/fnmatch.h
	- new version, with necessary symbols for the new fnmatch.c

tests/posixpat.{tests,right}, tests/run-posixpat
	- test suite for the POSIX.2 BRE pattern matching code

variables.c
	- make sure that array assignment using the compound syntax empties
	  the array before doing the assignment
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

trap.c
	- new function, trap_to_sighandler(sig), which returns the correct
	  trap handler for SIG depending on the information in sigmodes[sig]
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

sig.h
	- extern declarations for trap_handler and trap_to_sighandler
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

jobs.c
	- if we get an interrupt while waiting for a command to complete,
	  and there was a trap set on SIGINT that resets the handler to
	  SIG_DFL, the value that waitchld uses for old_trap_handler will
	  be wrong (it will be trap_handler, but trap_handler no longer
	  knows anything about SIGINT).  If old_signal_handler is trap_handler,
	  but signal_is_trapped(SIGINT) returns 0, we need to call
	  trap_to_sighandler to decide what to do

builtins/type.def
	- removed mention of `-type', `-path', and `-all' options from the
	  long help description

error.c, error.h
	- new function: internal_warning, for warning messages

variables.c
	- changed a call to internal_error to use internal_warning
	- modified change of 7/3 so that arrays are not emptied until
	  just before the shell is about to assign the new values, so
	  the old value can be used to generate the rhs of the assignment,
	  if necessary.  This is how `normal' shell variables work
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

jobs.c, jobs.h
	- delete_job now takes a second int argument and prints a warning
	  message when deleting a stopped job if the second argument is
	  non-zero

jobs.c, builtins/jobs.def
	- changed all calls to delete_job to provide a proper second arg

lib/readline/bind.c
	- broke rl_read_init_file into an `upper' and `lower' half in
	  preparation for adding file inclusion capability to inputrc
	  parsing
	- handle_parser_directive now displays an error message if an
	  unknown directive is encountered
	- parser_endif now prints an error message if an $endif without

	- added `$include' parser directive to read bindings and commands
	  from another file at that point

lib/readline/doc/rluser.texinfo, doc/{bash.{1,html},readline.3}
	- documented new readline `$include' parser directive

	  for CYGWIN32 users

lib/readline/kill.c
	- incorporated bfox's patches for `iterative' yank-last-arg handling.
	  This means that one can keep pressing M-. and move backwards in
	  the history, yanking the last argument of successive history lines

lib/readline/rlwinsize.h
	- new file, encapsulates various locations of the definition for
	  `struct winsize'

aclocal.m4
	- augmented BASH_STRUCT_WINSIZE to look in termios.h as well as

support/config.guess
	- add better support for SunOS on M68K (old Sun3 machines)

parse.y
	- check for compound array assignment in read_token_word only if

jobs.c, jobs.h
	- nohup_all_jobs and delete_all_jobs now take a parameter which

jobs.c
	- changed all calls to delete_all_jobs

builtins/jobs.def
	- added `-a' (all jobs) and `-r' (running jobs only) options to

builtins/Makefile.in
	- PROFILE_FLAGS is now substituted into the Makefile by configure

configure.in
	- new options, --enable-profiling and --enable-static-link, to turn

	  for use as a root shell.  The former implies the latter.  If
	  we're linking statically, dynamic loading of new builtins is not

	  [in bash-2.01.1]

lib/readline/{complete,bind}.c
	- new readline variable, print-completions-horizontally, which causes
	  matches to be printed across the screen (like `ls -x') rather than
	  up-and-down (like `ls')
	- new readline variable, completion-ignore-case, which causes filename

	- bumped the version number up to 2.02-alpha1

bracecomp.c
	- fixes so that the braces are not quoted by the filename quoting
	  function when complete-into-braces is executed with M-{.  The
	  brace completion functions do filename quoting themselves
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

pathexp.c

subst.c,execute_cmd.c
	- changed calls to quote_string_for_globbing to pass the correct
	  flag arguments

expr.c
	- added a `**' binary operator to do exponentiation (2**16 == 65536).
	  precedence is lower than arithmetic operators, higher than unary

	  exits with a status of 125 if one is attempted.  If there is an
	  expansion error, the shell exits with a status of 127.  If there
	  is a shell parsing error, the shell exits with a status of 126.
	  Otherwise, the exit status is 0.  The current output is

		number of words\n
		number of bytes\n
		expanded words, one per line, separated by newlines

	  This will have to be changed when an interface to glibc is coded

hashcmd.h
	- reduced the default size of the filename hash table from 631
	  to 107

sig.c
	- don't call initialize_siglist if HAVE_UNDER_SYS_SIGLIST is defined
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

siglist.c
	- don't compile this file if HAVE_UNDER_SYS_SIGLIST is defined
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

variables.c
	- fix to make $RANDOM work better in subshells
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

aclocal.m4
	- new macro, BASH_DECL_UNDER_SYS_SIGLIST, looks for _sys_siglist in
	  <signal.h> and <unistd.h>, defines UNDER_SYS_SIGLIST_DECLARED if
	  found
	  [in bash-2.01.1]
	- change BASH_UNDER_SYS_SIGLIST to require BASH_DECL_UNDER_SYS_SIGLIST,
	  like BASH_SYS_SIGLIST requires AC_DECL_SYS_SIGLIST
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

config.h.in
	- add a line for UNDER_SYS_SIGLIST_DECLARED
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

configure.in
	- make sure that SVR4_2 is defined for machines that have $host_os
	  sysv4.2* (e.g., sysv4.2MP) as well as $host == sysv4.2
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

				   7/29
				   ----
command.h
	- new command type, ARITH_COM, used to create and execute a ((...))
	  command without translating it into let "..."

parse.y
	- changes to the grammar and lexer so that ((...)) is parsed as a
	  command of type ARITH_CMD.  An ARITH_CMD is a WORD_LIST, for
	  future expansion, even though only the first word is used

make_cmd.c, make_cmd.h
	- definition and declaration of a function to build an arithmetic
	  command

dispose_cmd.c
	- added code to dispose of arithmetic commands

print_cmd.c
	- added code to print arithmetic commands, both `regularly' and
	  when they're being traced with `set -x'

externs.h
	- extern declaration for xtrace_print_arith_cmd

copy_cmd.c
	- added code to copy arithmetic commands

execute_cmd.c
	- added code to directly execute arithmetic commands -- they are
	  a shell_control_structure, so just about everything like
	  redirections and piping is taken care of by the boilerplate code.
	  All that's needed is to expand the expression (which is within
	  double quotes -- added by parse.y:parse_arith_cmd()), print it
	  if tracing is enabled, call the expression evaluator, and return
	  an appropriate result

				   7/30
				   ----
input.c
	- new function, set_buffered_stream(fd, bp), sets the buffered stream
	  associated with FD to BP and returns the old buffered stream

input.h
	- extern declaration for set_buffered_stream

parse.y
	- call set_buffered_stream rather than manipulating the BUFFERS array
	  directly

shell.c
	- unset_bash_input now takes an argument, CHECK_ZERO.  This tells it
	  whether to check whether default_buffered_input is >= 0 or just > 0

externs.h
	- changed extern declaration for unset_bash_input

execute_cmd.c, jobs.c, nojobs.c
	- changed calls to unset_bash_input to add appropriate argument

input.h
	- #undef B_* before defining them as flag values for b_flags.  Some
	  systems, like SVR4, have a B_ERROR define in a file included by
	  jobs.c and nojobs.c, and it causes a warning

				   7/31
				   ----
fnmatch.c
	- rewrote most of fnmatch(), so that it now implements ksh-88 style
	  pattern matching (`[@+*?!](patlist)') if the FNM_EXTMATCH flag
	  is set

fnmatch.h
	- added a define for FNM_EXTMATCH

				    8/4
				    ---
lib/readline/display.c
	- fixed _rl_redisplay_after_sigwinch () so that it really redisplays
	  only the portion after the final newline of a multi-line prompt
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

bashline.c
	- attempt_shell_completion no longer returns matches if a glob pattern
	  matches more than one filename -- it caused too many problems
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

				    8/5
				    ---
lib/glob/glob.c
	- updated glob_pattern_p so that the extended matching operators
	  are recognized

pathexp.c
	- udpated unquoted_glob_pattern_p so that the extended matching
	  operators are recognized
	- udpated quote_globbing_chars so that the extended matching
	  operators are recognized and quoted appropriately

subst.c
	- updated match_pattern_char so that the extended matching operators
	  are recognized

parse.y
	- updated read_token_word so that it parses an extended matching
	  pattern as a single word

jobs.c
	- if a job is suspended with SIGTSTP, and the user has set
	  checkwinsize with `shopt', update the window size
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

pathexp.c, pathexp.h
	- new global variable, extended_glob, controls whether the extended
	  pattern matching features are enabled

pathexp.h
	- new define, FNMATCH_EXTFLAG, to be OR'd with other values for
	  flags argument to fnmatch to enable the extended pattern matching
	  features if extended_glob is set

{pathexp,execute_cmd,bashhist,subst,test}.c, builtins/help.def
	- changed calls to fnmatch to add FNMATCH_EXTFLAG to the flags arg if
	  extended_glob is non-zero

lib/glob/glob.c
	- changed flags arg passed to fnmatch to include FNM_EXTMATCH if
	  extended_glob is non-zero (#ifdef SHELL)

				    8/6
				    ---
builtins/shopt.def
	- added a new `extglob' shell option, controls the value of
	  extended_glob

				    8/7
				    ---
doc/{bash.{1,html},bashref.texi}
	- documented new extended pattern matching operators and the `extglob'
	  shell option

tests/{extglob.{tests,right},run-extglob}
	- test suite for the new extended globbing features

				    8/8
				    ---
parse.y, pathexp.h, lib/glob/fnmatch.c
	- made the extended globbing code #ifdef EXTENDED_GLOB

config.h.in
	- added a line for EXTENDED_GLOB, controlled by configure

configure.in
	- new option, --enable-extended-glob, controls defining of
	  EXTENDED_GLOB (on by default)

doc/bashref.texi
	- documented new `configure' `--enable-extended-glob' option

				   8/11
				   ----
builtins/printf.def
	- new `printf' builtin, implemented according to POSIX.2 spec
	  for printf(1)

Makefile.in,builtins/Makefile.in
	- added necessary stuff for new printf builtin

				   8/12
				   ----
lib/readline/isearch.c
	- change to make ^G interrupt the incremental search correctly
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

configure.in, config.h.in
	- configure now checks for the availability of strtoul(3)

builtins/printf.def
	- use strtoul for the `%o', `%u', `%x', and `%X' formats if it
	  is available

				   8/13
				   ----
tests/{printf.{right,tests},run-printf}
	- extensive test suite for the new `printf' builtin

builtins/Makefile.in
	- change so that `builtext.h' is not recreated every time the source
	  file for a builtin is changed if the contents are the same.  This
	  keeps many files from being recompiled

				   8/14
				   ----
subst.c
	- changed verify_substring_values so that it returns -1 for substring
	  range errors, 0 for expression errors, and 1 for success
	  [in bash-2.01.1]
	- changed parameter_brace_substring to return an error if
	  verify_substring_values returns 0, and a null string if it returns
	  -1.  This matches the ksh93 behavior
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

trap.c
	- changed decode_signal so that it makes sure the first three
	  characters of a signal name are `SIG' before allowing the `SIG'
	  prefix to be omitted.  This is so a signal spec of `T' does not
	  match `EXIT', for instance
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

builtins/trap.def
	- make sure that showtrap() displays traps for signals with unknown
	  names using the signal number
	  [in bash-2.01.1]
shell.c
	- make sure that `bash -r' doesn't turn on the restricted mode until
	  after the startup files are executed
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

doc/{bash.{1,html},bashref.texi}
	- documented printf builtin

				   8/15
				   ----
general.c
	- added \xNNN escape to ansicstr -- NNN are up to three hex digits.
	  This affects $'...', `echo -e', and printf

builtins/printf.def
	- added \xNNN escape to bexpand -- NNN are up to three hex digits.
	  This affects printf's `%b' conversion specifier

doc/{bash.{1,html},bashref.texi}
	- documented new \xNNN escape sequence for echo, $'...', and printf

builtins/setattr.def
	- make sure that a variable found in the temp environment does not
	  cause a null string to be assigned by bind_variable (e.g.,
		foo="" export foo
	  )
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

				   8/18
				   ----
subst.c
	- fixed a bug that sometimes caused bad memory (pointer into an
	  allocated block) to be passed to free when doing arithmetic
	  substitution.  Bug report from stevet@myofb.org
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

				   8/19
				   ----
subst.c
	- considerable changes:  moved the code that expands a single
	  $... parameter expansion into a separate function: param_expand()
	  This function returns a string, which may contain characters
	  quoted with CTLESC or CTLNUL without doing word splitting
	- changed expand_word_internal to not remove the expansion of "$*"
	  if the number of positional parameters is > 0
	- changed the '"' case of expand_word_internal to remove quoted
	  nulls from the resultant word if the expansion was not "$@", and
	  the word is not a quoted null string ([] == CTLNUL, [1] == '\0')

subst.c, variables.c
	- moved the code that handles special variables from subst.c to
	  variables.c

				   8/20
				   ----
subst.c
	- rearranged the source a bit to group functions with similar
	  operation together
	- fixed parameter_brace_expand so that it no longer allows
	  indirect expansion of `special' variables
	- fixed parameter_brace_expand so taking the length of some of
	  the shell's special parameters works again
	- moved all of the code that computes the length of a shell
	  parameter (the ${#xxx} expansion) into parameter_brace_expand_length.
	  Previously, the code that handled the lengths of the shell's
	  special parameters was in parameter_brace_expand_word
	- valid indirect expansions are now only variable names or positional
	  parameters

				   8/21
				   ----
subst.c
	- fixed param_expand to raise an expansion error if $! is being
	  expanded and no asynchronous processes have been created
	- an expression error in a $((...)) arithmetic expansion now causes
	  a non-interactive shell running in POSIX mode to exit
	- relaxed change of 8/20 to allow indirect references to $#, $@, $*

builtins/bashref.texi
	- documented new posix-mode exit on invalid expressions in $((...))

lib/readline/complete.c
	- don't call rl_strpbrk unless rl_filename_quote_characters is not
	  NULL -- strpbrk requires non-NULL arguments
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

				   8/22
				   ----
bashline.c
	- don't make `history-expand-line' a bindable command unless
	  BANG_HISTORY is defined, and don't compile the code for that
	  command in unless BANG_HISTORY is defined
	- make history_expand_line(), tcsh_magic_space(), alias_expand_line(),
	  and history_and_alias_expand_line() int-returning functions that
	  return 0 for success and non-zero on error.  This allows
	  tcsh_magic_space() to just call history_expand_line() and insert
	  a space if that returns successfully
	- `magic-space' is now a bindable readline command

doc/bash.{1,html}, lib/readline/doc/rluser.texinfo
	- documented new `magic-space' bindable readline command

				   8/25
				   ----
parse.y
	- fixed decode_prompt_string so that values of $PWD longer than
	  PATH_MAX don't cause buffer overruns (char t_string[PATH_MAX])
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

general.c
	- fixed polite_directory_format so that values of $HOME longer
	  than PATH_MAX don't cause buffer overruns (char tdir[PATH_MAX])
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

subst.c
	- fix to expansion of $* so that the positional parameters are
	  separated by the first character of $IFS, even when the expansion
	  is not within double quotes, so the correct split is still
	  performed even when IFS does not contain a space.  Works for
	  ${*}, too
	- fix to expansion of $@ so that the positional parameters are
	  separated by the first character of $IFS, even when the expansion
	  is not within double quotes, so the correct split is still
	  performed even when IFS does not contain a space.  Works for
	  ${@}, too
	- new function, string_list_dollar_at(), which is to $@ as
	  string_list_dollar_star is to $*
	- fixed expansion of $@ so that splitting is still done even if
	  IFS is unset or NULL, as POSIX.2 specifies (section 3.5.2)
	- fixed expansion of $* so that it expands to multiple words if there
	  is more than one positional parameter, just like $@, even if
	  IFS is unset or NULL
	- new function list_quote_escapes, quotes (with CTLESC) all
	  CTLESC and CTLNUL characters in each member of the list

tests/dollar-{at,star}.sh
	- combined into dollar-at-star, changed run-dollars accordingly

				   8/26
				   ----
Makefile.in
	- make the `tests' target use $(SHELL) instead of hardcoding `sh'

				   8/29
				   ----
subst.c
	- expand_word_list_internal now takes a flags word as the second
	  argument, telling which expansions to perform on the WORD_LIST
	- broke expand_word_list_internal into several functions: one
	  each to do brace expansion, glob expansion, and the `normal'
	  shell expansions
	- new extern function: expand_words_shellexp() to perform the
	  `normal' shell expansions on a WORD_LIST

subst.h
	- extern declaration for expand_words_shellexp

bashline.c
	- fixed a problem with attempt_shell_completion where it attempted
	  to refer to rl_line_buffer[-1] (completion at the start of the
	  line, which means that ti == -1, which means that the test for
	  rl_line_buffer[ti] at line 715 was an array bounds error
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

eval.c
	- new function, parse_string_to_word_list(), which takes a string
	  and runs it through the parser, returning the resultant word
	  list

externs.h
	- new extern declaration for parse_string_to_word_list()

variables.c
	- change assign_array_var_from_string to first split the string
	  between the parens on whitespace, then expand the resultant
	  list of words with all the shell expansions before doing the
	  assignment

				    9/4
				    ---
redir.c, redir.h
	- redirection_error is no longer a static function

builtins/evalstring.c
	- changes to handle $( < filename ) (equivalent to $(cat filename))
	  as in ksh

lib/readline/bind.c
	- added two new functions: rl_unbind_function_in_map(func, map),
	  which unbinds all keys that execute FUNC in MAP; and
	  rl_unbind_command_in_map(command, map), which unbinds all keys
	  bound to COMMAND in MAP

lib/readline/readline.h
	- extern declarations for rl_unbind_{function,command}_in_map

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texi
	- documented rl_unbind_{function,command}_in_map

builtins/bind.def
	- added a new option, -u FUNCNAME, which unbinds all key sequences
	  bound to FUNCNAME in the specified (or current) keymap

doc/{bash.{1,html},bashref.texi}
	- documented new $( < filename ) command substitution
	- documented new bind -u FUNCNAME option

				    9/5
				    ---
shell.c
	- send SIGHUP to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits if
	  the variable `hup_on_exit' is non-zero
	- modified run_startup_files so that if `NON_INTERACTIVE_LOGIN_SHELLS'
	  is #define'd (perhaps in config.h.top, though there is nothing there
	  for it), all login shells (interactive and non-interactive) run
	  /etc/profile and one of the per-user login shell startup files

builtins/shopt.def
	- new shopt option `huponexit' to control the value of hup_on_exit

doc/{bash.{1,html},bashref.texi}
	- documented new `huponexit' shell option

				    9/8
				    ---
builtins/common.c
	- changed contains_shell_metas to return 1 if a tilde appears at the
	  start of a string or after a `=' or `:'
	- changed backslash_quote to quote a tilde if it appears at the start
	  of a string or after a `=' or `:'

lib/readline/complete.c
	- moved rl_tilde_expand to util.c; it doesn't really have anything
	  to do with completion
	- moved insert_text to readline.c, renamed it _rl_replace_text (since
	  that's really what it does), changed callers
	- moved code that postprocesses the list of completion matches into
	  a new function: postprocess_matches
	- new implementation of tcsh-like menu completion in a single new
	  function: rl_menu_complete

lib/readline/{funmap.c,readline.h}
	- necessary declarations for binding rl_menu_complete to the
	  new `menu-complete' command

doc/{bash.{1,html},readline.3}, lib/readline/doc/rluser.texinfo
	- documented new `menu-complete' bindable readline command

				    9/9
				    ---
jobs.c
	- delete_job should print a warning only if subshell_environment
	  is 0, so we don't print bogus warnings when shell scripts without
	  a leading #! are executed

				   9/10
				   ----
builtins/read.def
	- fixed the code so that the `read' is automatically restarted when
	  it returns -1 with errno == EINTR.  SIGINT is handled by the
	  interrupt handler, since interrupt_immediately is set to 1, so
	  this handles things like SIGCHLD
	  [in bash-2.01.1]

				   9/11
				   ----
test.c
	- reorganized the code slightly to make it easier to add the ksh-like
	  [[...]] compound command

test.h
	- new file, with extern declarations for functions available in test.c

externs.h
	- moved declaration of test_command to test.h

builtins/test.def
	- include `test.h'

				   9/16
				   ----
{command,make_cmd,dispose_cmd,externs,subst}.h
parse.y, subst.c
{make,dispose,copy,print,execute}_cmd.c
	- changes to add the new ksh-93 compatible [[...]] conditional command

configure.in
	- new enable option, --enable-cond-command, to compile in the [[...]]
	  command code

config.h.in
	- new #define, COND_COMMAND, to compile in the [[...]] command code

tests/{run-cond,cond.{tests,right}}
	- test suite for the new [[...]] command

{builtins,lib/{readline,glob,tilde}}/Makefile.in
	- explicit dependencies for .o files on .c files for losing makes
	  like Solaris

doc/{bash.{1,html},bashref.texi}
	- documented the new `[[' compound command
	- documented the test/[ builtin behavior based on the number of
	  arguments in the description of the builtin
	- made a new section for conditional expressions that just lists
	  the available primaries -- the connectives and other operators
	  are listed in the description of the [[ command and the test/[
	  builtin

				   9/18
				   ----
builtins/set.def
	- minus_o_option_commands is now a global function so the shopt
	  code can use it
	- minus_o_option_commands now takes an argument telling it which
	  options to print, just like list_minus_o_options
	- new function, print_minus_o_option, which prints the value of
	  a `set -o' option either in the traditional format or in the
	  format used by `set +o'
	- changed list_minus_o_opts and minus_o_option_commands to call
	  print_minus_o_option

builtins/shopt.def
	- `shopt -p' now causes output to be printed in a format reusable
	  as input (the format is a series of shopt commands, like the
	  output of `set +o')
	- fixed a bug that made `shopt -so' and `shopt -uo' not work
	- fixed list_shopt_o_options so that `shopt -op' acts like `set +o'
	- fixed list_shopt_o_options to that `shopt -op optname' prints the
	  value of optname in a reusable format
	- fixed list_some_o_options so that `shopt -ops' and `shopt -opu'
	  work and display output in a reusable format

				   9/19
				   ----
doc/{bash.{1,html},bashref.texi}
	- documented new `shopt -p' behavior

shell.c
	- made `bash +o' display the same output as `set +o' and then
	  start an interactive shell (previously `bash -o' and `bash +o'
	  displayed the same thing)

builtins/common.h
	- added prototypes to the extern function declarations

				   9/22
				   ----
builtins/evalstring.c
	- fixed the DISCARD case of the jump_to_top_level so that it
	  doesn't try to call dispose_command(command) after the
	  `pe_dispose' unwind frame gets run, since that disposes the
	  command

				   9/23
				   ----
test.[ch]
	- test_eaccess is now a global function so that globbing code can
	  use it

lib/glob/glob.c
	- rewrote glob_vector to be slightly more efficient and to not
	  read the directory if the filename pattern does not contain
	  any globbing chars.  This satisfies the POSIX requirement that
	  read permission is not required for a directory when the
	  pathname component does not contain a pattern character (bug
	  reported by jsm28@cam.ac.uk)

subst.c
	- fixed parameter_brace_expand so that ${array[@]} and ${array[*]}
	  behave correctly when IFS is unset or set to something that does
	  not contain a space (they should result in separate words, just
	  like $@ and $*)

tests/{run-array2,array-at-star,array2.right}
	- tests for the expansions of ${array[@]} and ${array[*]}, derived
	  from the tests in dollar-at-star

				   9/24
				   ----
jobs.c
	- fixed cleanup_dead_jobs so that it doesn't remove the job
	  containing last_asynchronous_pid from the job table.  This
	  fixes the POSIX.2 `wait' requirement problem

				   9/25
				   ----
parse.y
	- added `\r' escape sequence to the prompt expansion code

lib/readline/chardefs.h
	- added defines for ISOCTAL, OCTVALUE, isxdigit (if not defined),
	  and HEXVALUE

lib/readline/bind.c
	- added `normal' echo/printf-like backslash escapes to the
	  key sequence translation code, with the addition that \d
	  expands to RUBOUT.  This means that key sequence definitions
	  (before the `:') and macro values may contain these special
	  backslash-escape sequences
	- now that we can translate octal escape sequences in key bindings,
	  change _rl_get_keyname so that it turns characters with values
	  128-159 inclusive into octal escape sequences (\200-\237), since
	  those characters are not ASCII or ISO Latin 1

doc/{bash.{1,html},readline.3}, lib/readline/doc/rluser.texinfo
	- documented new backslash escapes for readline key sequence and
	  macro translation

builtins/pushd.def
	- new function, get_dirstack_from_string(char *string), returns an
	  element from the directory stack or null, treating the argument
	  exactly as `dirs string' would, with the exception that if
	  the first character of `string' is not `+' or `-', a `+' is
	  assumed

builtins/common.h
	- new extern declaration for get_dirstack_from_string

general.c
	- added code to bash_special_tilde_expansions to get the expansion
	  using get_dirstack_from_string() if the first character of the
	  tilde-prefix is a digit or the first character is a `+' or `-'
	  and the second is a digit

tests/dstack.{tests,right}
	- renamed from dirstack.{tests,right}

tests/dtack2.{tests,right}
	- new tests for the directory stack tilde expansion code

tests/run-dirstack
	- now runs both dstack and dstack2

				   10/3
				   ----
trap.c
	- reordered header file inclusion for irix 4

execute_cmd.c
	- fixed select_query so that a reply that is not a number is treated
	  the same as a numeric reply that is out of range

lib/readline/util.c
	- added a backwards-compatibility definition of _rl_savestring()

builtins/set.def
	- initialize_shell_options now takes an argument saying whether or
	  not we should parse $SHELLOPTS from the environment.  The shell
	  does not parse the value if it's restricted, running setuid, or
	  running in `privileged mode'

shell.c
	- change call to initialize_shell_options to add the correct argument

builtins/common.h
	- changed extern declaration for initialize_shell_options

doc/{bash.{1,html},bashref.texi}
	- added note that the shell ignores $SHELLOPTS in the environment at
	  startup if running in privileged mode
	- added note that the restricted shell does not parse $SHELLOPTS from
	  the environment at startup

aclocal.m4
	- change BASH_RLIMIT_TYPE so that it looks for rlim_t in
	  <sys/resource.h> as well as <sys/types.h>, for Solaris 2.6
	- new macro, BASH_LARGE_FILE_SUPPORT, to enable special compilation
	  options for large files on Solaris 2.6 (from eggert@twinsun.com)

mailcheck.c
	- the `file_size' member of the FILEINFO struct should be of
	  type `off_t'
	- the `size' variable in file_has_grown should be of type `off_t'
	- the RESET_MAIL_FILE macro should initialize file_size to 0, not 0L

builtins/Makefile.in
	- LDFLAGS and LOCAL_LDFLAGS are now set by configure
	- `mkbuiltins' is now created from `mkbuiltins.o' instead of directly
	  from the source to the executable

builtins/evalfile.c
	- fixed _evalfile so that it handles large files correctly on
	  systems where the st_size member of `struct stat' will not fit
	  into an `int'

builtins/mkbuiltins.c
	- don't assume that st_size fits into an int

input.[ch]
	- the `b_size' member of a struct BSTREAM is now of type `size_t'
	- changed third argument to make_buffered_stream to size_t; changed
	  caller
	- changed `size' variable in fd_to_buffered_stream to type `size_t'

general.h
	- include <sys/resource.h> if HAVE_SYS_RESOURCE_H and RLIMTYPE are
	  both defined, for possible necessary definition of RLIMTYPE
	  (e.g., on Solaris 2.6)

{execute_cmd,jobs}.c, builtins/times.def
	- don't include <sys/resource.h> explicitly if RLIMTYPE is defined,
	  since general.h will include it in that case

lib/readline/bind.c
	- new function, char *_rl_read_file(filename, sizep), which reads
	  FILENAME into a malloced buffer, returning the buffer and the
	  size of the buffer in *SIZEP

lib/readline/histfile.c
	- changed read_history_range and history_truncate_file to handle
	  large files

hashcmd.c
	- find_hashed_filename should not add `./' to the front of a pathname
	  that already begins with `./'

				   10/8
				   ----
support/config.sub
	- recognize `hppa2.0' as a valid machine architecture

aclocal.m4
	- changed BASH_CHECK_LIB_TERMCAP so that `gnutermcap' is not chosen
	  if `$prefer_curses' is set to something

bashhist.c
	- don't use HISTCONTROL or HISTIGNORE to remove lines from the
	  second and subsequent lines of a multi-line command
	  (current_command_line_count > 1).  Old code did this only when
	  command-oriented-history was enabled

doc/{bash.{1,html},bashref.texi}
	- changed descriptions of HISTCONTROL and HISTIGNORE to state that
	  these variables are not applied to the second and subsequent
	  lines of a multi-line command

builtins/hash.def, {copy,dispose}_cmd.c
	- include "bashtypes.h" -- cray machines need it because of their
	  oddball definition of `word'

configure.in
	- changed check of ${host_cpu} to check for `*cray*' and `*Cray*'
	  when deciding whether to include the GNU malloc, since it
	  seems that ${host_cpu} gets set to `CrayYMP'

				   10/9
				   ----
configure.in
	- look for strtod and strtol in libc
	- make lib/sh directory in build directory if not there
	- create lib/sh/Makefile

config.h.in
	- added HAVE_STRTOD and HAVE_STRTOL

Makefile.in
	- changes for lib/sh/libsh.a (shell library)

builtins/printf.def
	- took out the `#ifdef STRTOUL' code, since strtoul is in libsh.a,
	  and will be resolved from there if it's not in libc

variables.c
	- call strtol() instead of string_to_long()

general.c, general.h
	- removed string_to_long
	- changed legal_number to use strtol so it correctly sets errno
	  to ERANGE on overflow
	- moved bash_getcwd_errstr here from lib/sh/oslib.c

externs.h
	- moved extern declarations for functions defined in libsh to a
	  separate section of the file, added extern declarations for
	  other functions in libsh

builtins/ulimit.def
	- changed macro definition for string_to_rlimtype to call strtol
	  directly instead of string_to_long

lib/sh/clktck.c
	- moved get_clock_tck to its own file, since it's compiled in
	  unconditionally

lib/sh/getenv.c

lib/sh/{setlinebuf,strerror,strcasecmp}.c
	- moved {setlinebuf,strerror,strcasecmp}() from oslib.c to
	  individual files

lib/sh/Makefile.in, Makefile.in
	- changes for new files in lib/sh

aclocal.m4
	- new macro BASH_SYS_RESTARTABLE_SYSCALLS, which does what
	  AC_SYS_RESTARTABLE_SYSCALLS does, but using posix sigaction()

configure.in
	- call BASH_SYS_RESTARTABLE_SYSCALLS if ac_cv_sys_restartable_syscalls
	  is `no'

builtins/jobs.def
	- catch out-of-range jobs better in disown_builtin

configure.in
	- don't build with GNU malloc on cygwin32

trap.c
	- change signal_name to handle the case where signal_names[sig] is
	  NULL, which can happen on cygwin32

execute_cmd.c
	- changes to do_piping to make pipes text mode (O_TEXT) on cygwin32

cross-build
	- new directory with cache files and other stuff for cross-compiling
	  bash (currently only for building for cygwin32 on a Unix machine)

cross-build/cygwin32.cache
	- new file containing configuration variable assignments for
	  cygwin32 that would otherwise require a default case for AC_TRY_RUN

configure.in
	- source ${srcdir}/cross-build/cygwin32.cache on CYGWIN32 systems
	  if we're cross-compiling on a unix machine
	- set $CC_FOR_BUILD for cygwin32 cross-compiling environment

Makefile.in
	- CC_FOR_BUILD is now a variable set by configure

builtins/mkbuiltins.c
	- only check for read(2) returning <= 0 in extract_info() (error
	  and exit on < 0, warning and return on == 0)

builtins/evalfile.c
	- only check for read(2) returning <= 0 in _evalfile() (error and
	  and failure return on < 0, success on == 0 while short-circuting
	  rest of operation)

				   10/14
				   -----

vprint.c
	- moved to lib/sh/vprint.c

lib/sh/Makefile.in
	- added entries for vprint.[co] in the appropriate places

cross-build/win32sig.h
	- a version of signames.h for cross-compiling for the CYGWIN32
	  environment on a Unix machine (from noer@cygnus.com)

aclocal.m4
	- made all cases of AC_TRY_RUN and AC_TRY_COMPILE have reasonable
	  default cases for cross-compiling, and tell the user what they are

Makefile.in
	- removed vprint.c from shell sources and vprint.o from shell
	  objects
	- added a level of indirection for signames.h -- the variable
	  SIGNAMES_H is set by configure to either `lsignames.h' or
	  a file for a cross-compilation environment (currently only
	  the cygwin32 stuff is supported).  Then that file is copied
	  to `signames.h'.  `lsignames.h' is created by `mksignames' as
	  was previously used to create signames.h directly

configure.in
	- set SIGNAMES_H to either `$(srcdir)/cross-build/win32sig.h' or
	  `lsignames.h' as appropriate, substitute into Makefile

				   10/15
				   -----
builtins/Makefile.in
	- CC_FOR_BUILD is now set by configure and used to build mkbuiltins
	  and psize.aux

variables.h
	- new variable attribute `att_tempvar', set if the SHELL_VAR * was
	  constructed on the fly from the temporary environment

variables.c
	- find_name_in_env_array now sets the `att_tempvar' attribute on
	  the SHELL_VAR it creates

findcmd.c
	- search_for_command now disposes the SHELL_VAR created by searching
	  the temporary environment for $PATH, if it is found there
	- _find_user_command_internal also disposes of the SHELL_VAR if it
	  has the `att_tempvar' attribute set

builtins/setattr.c
	- show_name_attributes looks in the temporary environemnt, so it needs
	  to dispose the SHELL_VAR if it has the att_tempvar attribute set

subst.c
	- parameter_brace_expand_word now disposes of the SHELL_VAR returned
	  by find_variable if it has the att_tempvar attribute set
	- ditto for param_expand and word_split

builtins/kill.def
	- disallow null pid arguments instead of treating them as 0
	- display a usage message and return failure if no pid or job
	  arguments are supplied

				   10/16
				   -----
builtins/declare.def
	- make `var=value declare -x var' behave the same as
	  `var=value export var' and `var=value declare -r var' behave the
	  same as `var=value readonly var', now that we have the `tempvar'
	  attribute

				   10/22
				   -----
jobs.c
	- non-interactive shells shouldn't report jobs killed by a SIGINT,
	  even if the standard output is to a terminal
	- pretty_print_job should add a CR at the end of its output if the
	  shell is interactive and asynchronous notification is being
	  performed.  This fixes the problem with extra CRs in the output
	  of $(jobs)

general.c
	- changed canonicalize_pathname to change `//' into `/', but leave
	  other pathnames starting with two consecutive slashes alone

				   10/27
				   -----

lib/readline/histexpand.c
	- fixed history_expand so that the appearance of the history
	  comment character at the beginning of a word inhibits history
	  expansion for the rest of the line

				   10/29
				   -----
jobs.c,variables.c
	- moved set_pipestatus_array to variables.c

variables.c
	- new function, set_pipestatus_from_exit(int), which sets the
	  PIPESTATUS variable from a command's exit status

variables.h
	- extern declarations for set_pipestatus_from_exit and
	  set_pipestatus_array

execute_cmd.c
	- fixed execute_simple_command to call set_pipestatus_from_exit
	  if a foreground builtin or function, or a foreground null
	  command is executed

				   10/31
				   -----
shell.c
	- fixed run_startup_files to detect being run by sshd, and treat
	  that case as equivalent to being run by rshd

				   11/3

builtins/set.def
	- make sure `set -a' doesn't cause SHELLOPTS to be exported when
	  a change is made to one of the shell options

pathexp.c
	- fix to shell_glob_filename in the code that uses a POSIX glob
	  library

				   11/5
				   ----
jobs.c
	- fix cleanup_dead_jobs to hang onto the job corresponding to
	  last_asynchronous_pid only if the shell is not interactive
	  (this still has the problem that until a new async process
	  is started, the job will stay in the jobs table)

configure.in,aclocal.m4
	- added a new macro, BASH_TYPE_U_INT32_T, to check for u_int32_t
	  separately from int32_t, since there are systems (HP-UX 10.20)
	  that have a define for the latter but not the former

				   11/6
				   ----
jobs.c
	- cleanup_dead_jobs no longer checks whether the job it is deleting
	  corresponds to last_asynchronous_pid
	- notify_of_job_status and mark_dead_jobs_as_notified now will not
	  mark the job corresponding to last_asynchronous_pid as notified
	  if the shell is not interactive
	- wait_for_single_pid, if told to wait for last_asynchronous_pid,
	  or the job of which it is a member, will take care of marking
	  the job as notified after calling wait_for and collecting the
	  status.  This means that two successive `wait' calls for $! will
	  succeed the first time and fail the second, as POSIX.2 specifies
	  (take this code out if it causes problems)

				   11/7
				   ----
jobs.c
	- wait_for_job, if told to wait for the job corresponding to the
	  last async pid, will mark the job as notified after waiting for
	  it and collecting the status

general.h
	- fixed MEMBER macro to avoid reading past end of S (it used to
	  test s[1] before s[0], which is an error if s == "")

subst.c
	- expand_word_internal should free ISTRING before returning if
	  param_expand returns an error
	- parameter_brace_expand_word should free the memory it allocates
	  and passes to param_expand

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_arith_command should call dispose_words on the list
	  returned by expand_words

parse.y
	- after calling parse_arith_command, read_token needs to free the
	  string value that parse_arith_command fills in, since make_word
	  makes a copy of the string it's passed

				   11/10
				   -----
subst.c
	- cond_expand_word needs to free the value returned by string_list
	  after it is run through quote_string_for_globbing

parse.y
	- make sure cond_term frees yylval.word if it is just a `!' and
	  it's parsed as a term negation operator

variables.c
	- assign_array_var_from_string needs to free the word list returned
	  by parse_string_to_word_list after calling expand_words_shellexp
	  on it

execute_cmd.c
	- changed execute_simple_command to avoid saving the_printed_command
	  into command_line until just before it's needed.  This should save
	  time and prevent memory leaks on errors, but it must be watched
	  closely to make sure that the_printed_command doesn't change out
	  from under execute_simple_command before we copy it

				   11/12
				   -----
builtins/alias.def
	- alias and unalias should print error messages when passed an
	  argument that is not an alias for printing or deletion,
	  respectively, even if the shell is not interactive

builtins/exit.def
	- `logout' will no longer exit a non-login non-interactive shell

				   11/17
				   -----
lib/readline/nls.c
	- add `koi8-r' as a legal LANG value

builtins/alias.def
	- if `alias' or `alias -p' is executed when no aliases are defined,
	  the return status should be 0, according to POSIX.2

				   11/18
				   -----
subst.c
	- changed a couple of calls to make_word_list (make_word(z), ...)
	  to add_string_to_list (z, ...)

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_cond_command now sets this_command_name to `[['

				   11/21
				   -----
variables.c
	- all_visible_{function,variable}s and the functions they call
	  should be compiled in only if READLINE is defined

aclocal.m4
	- remove some leading whitespace before preprocessor statements in
	  BASH_KERNEL_RLIMIT_CHECK

general.[ch]
	- fix declarations for group_member so the extern declaration in
	  general.h agrees with the definition in general.c (fix from
	  Andreas Schwab <schwab@issan.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>)

builtins/cd.def
	- print the new working directory if the shell is interactive
	  and `cd -' succeeds
	- don't print the new working directory if it's found in $CDPATH
	  if the shell is not interactive

				   11/25

support/config.guess
	- add support for new OS name for SINIX SVR4 systems

				   12/3
				   ----

builtins/set.def
	- `unset' should check that a function it's trying to unset is a
	  legal identifier only when in POSIX mode

redir.c
	- changed here_document_to_fd to try and make sure the filename
	  used for the here document is `more unique', since the old
	  version would fail if two here documents were created in less
	  than a second

				   12/4
				   ----
builtins/cd.def
	- POSIX.2 says that if CDPATH is used to find the new directory,
	  and it's not relative to the current directory, the new directory
	  name should be displayed on stdout even if the shell is not
	  interactive

				   12/5
				   ----
parse.y
	- changes so that `time' is recognized as a reserved word only at
	  the beginning of a pipeline (the last read token is one of 0,
	  `;', `\n', `&&', `||', or `&'):

		o add clause to special_case_tokens that does the check
		  and returns TIME if the conditions are met
		o take check for `TIME' out of CHECK_FOR_RESERVED_WORD, but
		  leave it in the word_token_alist so that `type' still
		  reports it as a `keyword'
		o new function, time_command_acceptable(), encapsulates the
		  necessary conditions for `time' to be returned as a 
		  reserved word

parse.y
	- make sure the code for pushing and popping strings is compiled in
	  if either ALIAS or DPAREN_ARITHMETIC is defined, because the ((

	- fix cond_skip_newlines so it resets the prompt to $PS2 while
	  parsing an unfinished conditional command

dispose_cmd.c, copy_cmd.c, builtins/hash.def
	- fixes to not use `word' as a variable name or the name of a
	  function parameter to get around stuff in the Cray Unix include
	  files

builtins/printf.def
	- return failure immediately if an illegal format character is
	  encountered

redir.c
	- make the code that creates here-documents behave better if the
	  file it's trying to create already exists for some reason

lib/readline/complete.c
	- changed print_filename to return the number of characters it
	  outputs; changed callers to use that value.  This makes columns
	  line up when printing completion listings with filenames
	  containing control characters

doc/bash.{1,html}
	- fixed a typo in the quote removal section

				   1/30

parse.y
	- free_string_list() needs to check that t->expander is not NULL

	- reset_parser() doesn't need to set pushed_string_list to NULL
	  after calling free_string_list(), since free_string_list does it

configure.in,cross-build/cygwin32.cache
	- fixes from Geoff Noer for better cygwin32 cross-compilation

tests/printf.{tests,right}
	- removed test for integer overflow, since error messages differ
	  across systems

pathexp.c
	- fixed a problem with unquoted_glob_pattern_p that made things
	  like `x+*' not expand correctly

lib/glob/glob.c
	- fixed a problem with glob_pattern_p that made things like `x+*'
	  not expand correctly

builtins/cd.def
	- if `cd -P' is executed, or `set -o physical' has been executed,
	  the value of $PWD after a successful cd will not contain any

builtins/common.c
	- take out the code in backslash_quote() that looks for tildes to

	  information -- TENTATIVE CHANGE

lib/sh/getcwd.c
	- fix from Paul Smith to make getcwd() behave better in the presence
	  of lstat(2) failures

stringlib.c
	- when copying the replacement string into the output string being
	  constructed, strsub() needs to make sure enough space for the
	  replacement string is allocated, not the length of the pattern
	  (use REPLEN, not PATLEN)

mailcheck.c
	- make sure make_default_mailpath() has a valid current_user struct
	  before trying to construct the default mailpath

				    2/5

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_builtin needs to call run_unwind_frame if the builtin is
	  `source' or `eval' and we're not in a subshell rather than just
	  calling dispose_builtin_env, because not all invocations copy 
	  the temporary_env to builtin_env, and nested calls to `.' require
	  that the temporary env given to the first persist until that first
	  call to `.' finishes

parse.y
	- fix to history_delimiting_chars so that function definitions like

		function xyz
		{
			echo a
		}

	  are saved to the history correctly when command_oriented_history
	  is enabled, but literal_history is not

bashhist.c
	- when calling internal_error from pre_process_line, use "%s" as
	  the format with history_value as the argument to avoid the
	  problem with the failed history event containing printf escape
	  sequences

shell.c

support/bashbug.sh

examples/loadables/Makefile.in
	- converted from `Makefile' with some boilerplate configure variables
	  to find the source and build directories -- still requires some
	  hand-editing to get the right CFLAGS and LDFLAGS for shared object
	  creation

Makefile.in
	- create examples/loadables/Makefile with `make makefiles'

configure.in
	- create examples/loadables directory so `make makefiles' can write a
	  makefile there

general.c

lib/sh/itos.c, general.c
	- new file, itos() from general.c.  This is here because the

Makefile.in, lib/sh/Makefile.in
	- changes to add itos.c in libsh.a

externs.h, general.h

	  before trying to do anything with it

jobs.c
	- add a call to internal_warning from wait_for_job if the job is
	  stopped
	- changed notify_of_job_status to not report pipelines exiting due to
	  SIGPIPE in non-interactive shells if the shell is compiled with
	  -DDONT_REPORT_SIGPIPE

builtins/psize.sh
	- some fixes to try to avoid /tmp file races and surreptitious
	  substitutions

version.c
	- changed the extended version info to show 1998 as the copyright year

parse.y
	- fixes from Andreas Schwab <schwab@LS5.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>
	  for compilation errors when the shell is configured --disable-alias
	  but with dparen arithmetic enabled

eval.c
	- fixes from Andreas Schwab <schwab@LS5.informatik.uni-dortmund.de> to
	  make sure the input stream is popped correctly when performing an
	  array assignment in the command argument to `bash -c', e.g.,
	  `bash -c 'A=()''

builtins/kill.def
	- make `kill' with no arguments print a usage message and return a
	  failure status

alias.c
	- fix so that rd_token doesn't dump core when trying to do alias
	  expansion on a line containing an unclosed single quote (fix from
	  Vasco Pedro <vp@di.fct.unl.pt>)

builtins/cd.def
	- fix so that using a non-empty directory from CDPATH to construct
	  the name of the directory to change to results in an absolute
	  pathname of the new current working directory being displayed,
	  as POSIX.2 specifies

support/bashbug.sh
	- a couple of small fixes to minimize /tmp file races -- the script
	  is still raceable, the window is just smaller

				   3/24
				   ----
variables.c
	- make sure assign_in_env passes a malloc'd string to
	  expand_string_unsplit, because some of the error code assumes that
	  it is malloc'd and frees it (bug reported by Marko.Makela@HUT.FI)

				   3/25
				   ----
doc/bashref.texi
	- changed the email addresses to use the @email texinfo tag

trap.c
	- call reset_parser from the exit trap code before calling
	  parse_and_execute, so reserved words are parsed correctly

subst.c
	- make sure parameter_brace_patsub expands the pattern string as if
	  the expression were not in double quotes, even if the entire
	  expansion is enclosed in double quotes, so that quote removal
	  on embedded double quotes is performed correctly (bug report from
	  schwab@issan.informatik.uni-dortmund.de)

	  are defined
	  [in bash-2.02.1]

				   4/22
				   ----
make_cmd.c
	- make sure that make_here_document allocates enough space for the
	  first line of the here document, by using the line length +2
	  (instead of 1000, which is what the old code did, and breaks if
	  the first line of the here document is enough longer than 1000
	  characters to cause other memory to be scribbled on)
	  [in bash-2.02.1]

builtins/cd.def
	- when in posix mode, a value of "" for CDPATH should be treated the
	  same as the current directory, not result in an error
	  [in bash-2.02.1]

lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- change the mh_align member of `union mhead' to be of type double
	  rather than a pointer, so that malloc will return (hopefully)
	  8-byte aligned memory
	  [in bash-2.02.1]

				   4/23
				   ----
aclocal.m4
	- add a new macro to check whether or not off_t is 64 bits 

				   4/24
				   ----
configure.in
	- fixed a typo so the bash malloc is not compiled in on mips-sgi-irix6

lib/readline/display.c
	- fix for readline redisplay if the prompt string is longer than the
	  screen width and includes invisible characters
	  [in bash-2.02.1]

jobs.c
	- make_child should not set the terminal's process group to
	  pipeline_pgrp if pipeline_pgrp == shell_pgrp (indicating that we
	  are forking a child for a command substitution)
	  [in bash-2.02.1]

subst.c
	- in execute_simple_command, in the child forked if there is a pipe
	  or the command is asynchronous, set subshell_environment to
	  SUBSHELL_ASYNC only if the command is asynchronous, SUBSHELL_FORK
	  if there is a pipe in or out
	  [in bash-2.02.1]

support/texi2dvi
	- upgraded to version 0.8 (from 0.5)

support/texi2html
	- upgraded to version 1.52 (from 1.51)

support/config.sub
	- config.sub now recognizes all the permutations of the system name
	  that config.guess produces for alphas
	  [in bash-2.02.1]

aclocal.m4
	- changed BASH_TYPE_INT32_T, BASH_TYPE_U_INT32_T, and
	  BASH_TYPE_PTRDIFF_T to avoid compiling a program; instead use
	  the values determined by the AC_CHECK_SIZEOF tests to determine
	  the default values to supply to AC_CHECK_TYPE

configure.in
	- don't call AC_CHECK_TYPE({int32_t,u_int32_t,ptrdiff_t}) from
	  configure.in; use the updated BASH_TYPE macros instead

builtins/exec.def
	- if shell_execve fails, set ARGS to null because the realloc() call
	  by shell_execve may have caused it to be reallocated and freed --
	  we don't want to free the memory twice

lib/glob/fnmatch.c
	- fixes from ache@nagual.pp.ru to make fnmatch work for eight-bit
	  characters when `isupper' and `islower' are used -- they were
	  restricted to ASCII characters before, probably to work around
	  some ancient, broken C libraries in which is{low,upp}er are valid
	  only for ASCII characters and return bogus values otherwise
	  [in bash-2.02.1]

				   4/29
				   ----
builtins/cd.def
	- fixed a problem with the shell displaying the old working directory
	  instead of the new one after changing to a directory found via
	  $CDPATH when in physical mode (set -o physical)
	  [in bash-2.02.1]

make_cmd.c
	- make make_cond_command initialize the line number from the cond_node
	  that's passed as an argument (not that it's used right now)

copy_cmd.c
	- make sure that copy_cond_command copies the type of the cond command,
	  since execute_cond_command uses that to decide what kind of test
	  to perform
	  [in bash-2.02.1]

builtins/printf.def
	- make sure the for loop that processes the format string actually
	  consumes arguments; otherwise process it only once to avoid
	  infinite loops (e.g., `printf " " abc def ghi')
	  [in bash-2.02.1]
	- if the format string is empty after preprocessing by ansicstr,
	  return immediately
	  [in bash-2.02.1]

tests/run-printf
	- use `diff -a' so the presence of a non-printing character in the
	  output doesn't confuse diff into thinking the files are binary
	  (test whether or not `diff' supports `-a' first)

Makefile.in
	- keep $(LOCAL_LIBS) from being specified twice

				   4/30
				   ----
support/shobj-conf
	- a script to generate variables to do shared object configuration
	  for the loadable builtin stuff

configure.in
	- added a section for shared object configuration using an `eval'
	  of the output of shobj-conf and substituting the generated values
	  with AC_SUBST

examples/loadables/Makefile.in
	- the system-specific shared object configuration variables are now
	  substituted by configure

				    5/4
				    ---
builtins/ulimit.def
	- some changes for HPUX 9.x's peculiar handling of RLIMIT_FILESIZE
	- changed the limit retrieval functions to return an error code
	  and the value in a reference argument to avoid use of RLIM_INVALID

general.c
	- new function, get_group_array(), which returns an array of
	  gids

examples/loadables/{id,printenv,sync,uname,whoami,push}.c
	- new loadable builtins

variables.c
	- moved code that initializes $PPID into a new function, set_ppid()

variables.h
	- extern declaration for set_ppid()

				    5/6
				    ---
subst.c
	- make sure that the `"' (double-quoted string) case of
	  expand_word_internal calls string_list_dollar_at if we've expanded
	  a double-quoted $@ so correct splitting on $IFS is done when
	  the expansion is complete.  We can't simply call string_list
	  because that forces a space separator, and $IFS may not contain
	  a space
	  [in bash-2.02.1]

				    5/7
				    ---
builtins/umask.def
	- broke the code that parses a symbolic mode out of symbolic_umask
	  into a separate function that takes a symbolic mode and an initial
	  set of bits to modify

examples/loadables/mkdir.c
	- new loadable builtin

				   5/11
				   ----
builtins/printf.def
	- use the format string length provided by ansicstr() to process the
	  format string, rather than testing for nullness, to handle NUL
	  bytes in the expanded format string

builtins/pushd.def
	- changes so it can be built as both a regular builtin and a loadable
	  builtin from the same source

examples/loadables/Makefile.in
	- changes to build pushd.c from ${topdir}/builtins/pushd.def and then
	  compile it with the correct flags to make it a loadable builtin,
	  even if PUSHD_AND_POPD is not defined in config.h

				   5/12
				   ----
lib/readline/complete.c
	- use rl_completer_quote_characters instead of #ifdef SHELL/#endif
	  code in make_quoted_replacement.  This means complete.c no longer
	  has any #ifdef SHELL code

				   5/13
				   ----
builtins/Makefile.in
	- `make clean' should remove mkbuiltins.o

Makefile.in
	- all of the various `clean' targets need to descend into lib/sh
	  and run the appropriate target there

builtins/type.def
	- changed to use the builtin getopt.  The old long options are
	  handled by prescanning the argument list looking for the long
	  options, processing them, and taking them out of the list before
	  passing it to internal_getopt()

lib/readline/signals.c
	- removed #ifdef SHELL code -- job control signals and SIGTERM are
	  always set in rl_set_signals, but are set to SIG_IGN if the old
	  handler was SIG_IGN (as bash sets it)
	- new function rl_maybe_set_sighandler, which sets the signal
	  disposition back to SIG_IGN if the old handler was SIG_IGN
	- removed #ifdef HANDLE_JOB_SIGNALS and #ifdef HANDLE_SIGTERM code

lib/readline/rltty.c
	- removed #ifdef SHELL code -- set_winsize is always called
	  to force the application to stop if it's not in the foreground
	  before getting the tty attributes

				   5/14
				   ----
lib/readline/signals.c
	- readline now catches SIGQUIT and cleans up the tty before resending
	  it to its container application (unless the calling application has
	  set the disposition of SIGQUIT to be SIG_IGN)
	- rl_handle_sigwinch is now called rl_sigwinch_handler
	- rl_sigwinch_handler now calls rl_resize_terminal to fetch the
	  screen size after a SIGWINCH
	- the sighandler_cxt struct for non-posix systems now includes
	  sa_flags and sa_mask variables, for future use
	- new variable, rl_catch_signals, indicating that readline should
	  install its own signal handlers for SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGQUIT,
	  SIGALRM, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, and SIGTTOU
	- new variable, rl_catch_sigwinch, indicating that readline should
	  install its own SIGWINCH handler, which will chain to a calling
	  application's SIGWINCH handler
	- new function, rl_free_line_state(), to free up variable state
	  associated with the current line after receiving a signal
	- new function, rl_cleanup_after_signal(), to clean up the display
	  and terminal state after receiving a signal
	- new function, rl_reset_after_signal(), to reinitialize the
	  terminal state after a signal handler returns and readline
	  continues
	- rl_set_signals and rl_clear_signals now look at the values of
	  rl_catch_signals and rl_catch_sigwinch

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- new function rl_resize_terminal (), to reset readline's idea of
	  the screen size after a SIGWINCH

lib/readline/readline.h
	- extern declarations for rl_resize_terminal(), rl_free_line_state(),
	  rl_cleanup_after_signal(), rl_reset_after_signal()
	- extern declarations for rl_catch_signals and rl_catch_sigwinch

variables.c
	- new functions, get_env_value(char *) and get_home_dir(void) to
	  satisfy references from the tilde and readline libraries when
	  they are compiled as part of bash

lib/tilde/tilde.c
	- rely on extern declarations of get_env_value and get_home_dir;
	  there is no more #ifdef SHELL code

lib/readline/shell.c
	- implementation of get_home_dir that uses getpwuid() to satisfy
	  references from tilde.c when not compiled as part of bash
	- removed savestring()
	- removed #ifdef SHELL/#endif pair -- all of these functions will be
	  resolved from bash when readline is linked into bash

lib/readline/savestring.c
	- new file, with function definition for savestring() for backwards
	  compatibility

Makefile.in, _distribution
	- bumped things up to bash-2.03-alpha

				   5/15
				   ----
lib/readline/rlconf.h
	- removed #ifdef SHELL/#endif pair, so the callback stuff will be
	  compiled into libreadline, but never linked into bash (since it's
	  not referenced)

configure.in
	- added new `--with-installed-readline' option to allow readline to
	  be linked with an already-installed version -- this will probably
	  not work with versions of readline prior to 2.3 (libreadline.so.4)
	  [THIS IS STILL UNDOCUMENTED]

Makefile.in
	- changed necessary variables to allow the `--with-installed-readline'
	  option to work; shared and static libraries are supported

				   5/18
				   ----
lib/readline/display.c
	- _rl_save_prompt is now rl_save_prompt; _rl_restore_prompt is now
	  rl_restore_prompt

lib/readline/readline.h
	- extern declarations for rl_save_prompt and rl_restore_prompt

lib/readline/{search,isearch,readline,display}.c
	- converted calls to _rl_{save,restore}_prompt () to use new public
	  versions

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- documented new public functions rl_{save,restore}_prompt

				   5/19
				   ----
lib/readline/readline.c
	- new hook function variable, rl_pre_input_hook.  If non-zero, it's
	  called from readline_internal_setup just before it returns and
	  readline starts reading input

lib/readline/readline.h
	- extern declaration for rl_pre_input_hook

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- documented new variable rl_pre_input_hook

				   5/20
				   ----
lib/readline/complete.c
	- new hook function variable, rl_completion_display_matches_hook.
	  If non-null, this function is called when readline would normally
	  display the list of completion matches

lib/readline/readline.h
	- extern declaration for rl_completion_display_matches_hook

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- documented rl_completion_display_matches_hook

lib/readline/readline.c
	- if RL_LIBRARY_VERSION is not defined, define it to 4.0 to match
	  the version number of the shared libraries

lib/readline/doc/{hist,rlman}.texinfo
	- changed the version and edition to 4.0 to match the library version

support/config.guess
	- added case clause for matching UnixWare 7 from SCO (SVR5) -- further
	  work may be needed 
	  [These fixes were in a usenet posting from hops@sco.com]

support/config.sub
	- added case clauses to recognize various aliases for SCO Open Server
	  and Open Desktop
	  [in bash-2.02.1]
	- broke the code that canonicalizes unixware into unixware2 and
	  unixware7 clauses (multiple places)
	  [in bash-2.02.1]
	- added clause to recognize `sysv5' for SVR5
	  [These fixes were in a usenet posting from hops@sco.com]
	  [in bash-2.02.1]

configure.in
	- add `-b elf' to LOCAL_CFLAGS for sco3.2v5* to allow dynamic linking
	  (and loadable builtins)
	- add AC_DEFINE(SVR5) on SVR5 (unixware 7)

config.h.in
	- add #undef SVR5, set by configure

				   5/21

shell.c
	- line-buffer stdout and stderr in shell_initialize only if
	  shell_initialized is 0 on all systems, not just SunOS 5
	  [in bash-2.02.1]

support/rlvers.sh
	- script to print out the version number of any installed
	  readline library

configure.in
	- only allow --with-installed-readline if the version of the
	  installed readline library is 4.0 or greater

				   5/22
				   ----
lib/readline/complete.c
	- broke the code that actually displays a list of completion
	  matches on the output stream into a separate public function,
	  rl_display_match_list, so it can be called from the hook
	  function rl_completion_display_matches_hook.

lib/readline/readline.h
	- new extern declaration for rl_display_match_list

lib/readline/rltech.texinfo
	- documented rl_display_match_list

configure.in,Makefile.in
	- --enable-static-link now creates a STATIC_LD variable in Makefile
	  rather than adding to LDFLAGS directly.  LDFLAGS now includes
	  $(STATIC_LD)

				    6/2
				    ---
builtins/cd.def
	- OLDPWD is now auto-exported
	- broke the code out of bindpwd() that updated the value of PWD in
	  the export environment in-place and made it general, so it can
	  be used for OLDPWD, too (this should be made *more* general, and
	  moved to variables.c)

				    6/3
				    ---
variables.c
	- moved builtins/cd.def:export_pwd_var to here, renamed it to
	  update_export_env_inplace
	- converted put_command_name_into_env to just call
	  update_export_env_inplace
	- made dummy variable for OLDPWD, marked as invisible and exported,
	  in initialize_shell_variables

variables.h
	- extern declaration for update_export_env_inplace

builtins/cd.def
	- changed calls to export_pwd_var to update_export_env_inplace

lib/readline/bind.c
	- added missing return in rl_unbind_function_in_map
	- changed _rl_read_file to check whether or not `read' returns
	  < 0 rather than < file_size
	- _rl_read_init_file needs to free `openname' after calling
	  _rl_read_file, since it's not used again

lib/readline/callback.c
	- bogus extern declaration for `readline_internal_startup', should
	  be readline_internal_setup

lib/readline/histfile.c
	- read_history_range now checks whether read(2) returns < 0 rather
	  than checking the return value against the file size

lib/readline/parens.c
	- whoops -- timer.tv_usec is *micro* seconds, not milliseconds

lib/readline/readline.c
	- initialize `eof' to 1 in readline_internal_charloop

				    6/5
				    ---
configure.in
	- if we're configuring with an installed version of readline, set and
	  have configure substitute RL_INCLUDE to `-I$(includedir)', so the
	  build process uses the installed readline include files as well as
	  the libraries

Makefile.in, builtins/Makefile.in
	- add @RL_INCLUDE@ in the appropriate places, substituted by configure

lib/readline/{history,readline}.h
	- add `extern "C"' wrapper if `__cplusplus' is defined

lib/glob/fnmatch.h
	- include stdc.h
	- add prototypes to extern declaration for fnmatch()

lib/readline/rlstdc.h
	- link to ../posixheaders/stdc.h (in readline lib with different name
	  for benefit of standalone readline library installation)

lib/readline/{history,keymaps}.h
	- include rlstdc.h
	- add prototypes to all of the extern function declarations

lib/readline/history.h
	- the `data' member of a HIST_ENTRY is now a histdata_t, which is
	  either a void * (ansi c) or a char * (k&r c)

lib/readline/readline.c
	- changed calls to replace_history_entry to pass a histdata_t as the
	  third parameter

				    6/8
				    ---
copy_cmd.c
	- make sure that copy_cond_command doesn't blindly try to copy
	  com->op, since that will be null for AND and OR nodes, at least
	  [in bash-2.02.1]

lib/readline/vi_mode.c
	- added missing second argument to rl_vi_[fbe][Ww]ord(), since
	  they're used as pseudo-bindable commands (they appear in the
	  default funmap) as well as utility functions

lib/readline/readline.h
	- include rlstdc.h
	- added prototypes for functions from vi_mode.c, util.c, terminal.c,
	  search.c, util.c, undo.c, readline.c, parens.c, macro.c, kill.c,
	  keymaps.c, isearch.c, input.c, funmap.c, display.c, complete.c,

lib/readline/{readline,util}.c
	- rl_refresh_line now takes the standard two arguments for bindable
	  commands; changed callers

lib/readline/*.c
	- small cleanups for incorrect arguments, etc. uncovered by use of
	  function prototypes

bashline.c
	- small cleanups for incorrect arguments, etc. uncovered by use of
	  function prototypes

jobs.c
	- cast result of strsignal() to (char *) for the benefit of broken
	  Cray UNICOS machines
	  [in bash-2.02.1]

configure.in,aclocal.m4
	- new test, BASH_TYPE_BITS64_T, used to find out what basic type is
	  64 bits long; defaults to `double'
	- call AC_CHECK_SIZEOF(double)

config.h.in
	- #define for bits64_t, undef by default

				   6/24
				   ----
aclocal.m4
	- changed BASH_TYPE_BITS64_T so that it checks the size of a char *
	  first, before trying sizeof(double)

lib/readline/doc/rluser.texinfo,doc/{bash.1,readline.3}
	- changed default binding for tilde-expand to M-&, since bash
	  overrides M-~ to force username completion

bashline.c
	- fixed an off-by-one error in hostnames_matching that exhibited
	  itself when an exact multiple of 16 hostnames matched (fix
	  from <davidg@nikhef.nl>)
	  [in bash-2.02.1]

				   6/30

lib/readline/readline.c
	- the maximum numeric argument is now 1000000

bashline.c
	- fixed a bug in bash_directory_completion_hook that caused memory
	  to be freed twice if a directory name containing an unset
	  variable was completed and `set -u' had been set

configure.in
	- on LynxOS, add a -DRECYCLES_PIDS to LOCAL_CFLAGS

execute_cmd.c
	- make sure that the changes to make the shell fork early when
	  run in the background do not cause commands such as `%1 &'
	  to fork
	  [in bash-2.02.1]
	- if RECYCLES_PIDS is defined, execute_command_internal sets
	  last_made_pid to NO_PID after waiting for a foreground process,
	  if the return status is 0 (fix from plai@Lynx.COM (Paul Lai))

lib/readline/kill.c
	- fixes from Andreas Schwab to rl_yank_last_arg that make it
	  behave better

lib/readline/input.c
	- fixes from Donald Beaudry <donb@sgi.com> to make the input buffering
	  and rl_stuff_char work right when the input buffer is nearly full
	  (probably not a problem with keyboard input, but maybe a problem
	  with programmers attempting to use rl_stuff_char to preload the
	  input buffer)

				   7/14
				   ----
parse.y
	- fix to decode_prompt_string so that the \$ expansion quotes the `$'
	  so it won't be processed by subsequent parameter expansion
	- change read_token_word so a $$ appearing in a token is recognized
	  and parsed immediately, so a single or double quote after the
	  second `$' doesn't cause ANSI-C expansion or locale translation
	  (bug report from haertel@ichips.intel.com)

builtins/mkbuiltins.c
	- if the number of characters read from the .def file is less than
	  the file size reported by `stat', and the read completed without

	  `wordlist' after the `in' keyword in a for statement

				   7/23
				   ----
doc/bash.1
	- corrected the synopsis of the `for' and `select' statements to
	  indicate that the semicolon (or newline) after the optional
	  `in words' is required

[bash-2.02.1 released]

				   7/28
				   ----
lib/readline/display.c
	- make sure visible_length is initialized to 0 in rl_expand_prompt.
	  Fix from Gerhard Niklasch <nikl@mathematik.tu-muenchen.de>.

lib/glob/glob.c
	- make sure that quotes are removed from the filename being globbed
	  in glob_vector() before calling the GLOB_TESTNAME macro if there
	  are no globbing characters in the pattern

doc/Makefile.in
	- make sure that builtins.1 is looked for in $(srcdir) when running
	  `make install' (it's still commented out, though)

				   7/30
				   ----
config.h.bot
	- if PROMPT_STRING_DECODE is not defined, define PPROMPT (the primary
	  prompt string) as "$ "

variables.c
	- if PROMPT_STRING_DECODE is not defined, and current_user.euid == 0,
	  PS1 defaults to "# ", otherwise it defaults to `primary_prompt'

doc/bashbug.1
	- fixed email address prep.ai.mit.edu -> gnu.org

				    8/3
				    ---
support/shobj-conf
	- add `solaris2' as a possible OS name, treated the same as sunos5

				    8/4
				    ---
shell.c
	- changed maybe_make_restricted() so that $ENV and $BASH_ENV are
	  read-only variables in a restricted shell

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- added ENV and BASH_ENV to the list of readonly variables in
	  restricted mode

parse.y
	- added `do', `then', `else', `{', and `(' to the list of keywords
	  that may precede the `time' reserved word

general.c
	- added sanity checks to timeval_to_secs and clock_t_to_secs so
	  that if the fractional part is >= 1000, 1 is added to the
	  seconds and 1000 is subtracted from the fractional seconds

				    8/6
				    ---
Makefile.in
	- use $(CC_FOR_BUILD) to build mksignames

configure.in
	- changes to allow cross-building for BeOS as well as cygwin32

cross-build/{beos-sig.h,x86-beos.cache}
	- new files for cross-compiling for BeOS

				    8/7
				    ---
Makefile.in
	- changed rule for version.h to use && instead of if-then-else-fi to
	  make sure the recipe fails if mkversion.sh fails

configure.in
	- beos does not use the GNU malloc

lib/sh/itos.c
	- broke itos into inttostr(i, buf, len) and itos(i), which calls
	  inttostr and returns a newly-allocated string with the result

support/mksignames.c
	- define `SIGKILLTHR' if system include files define it

externs.h
	- extern declaration for inttostr(int, char *, int)

				   8/13
				   ----
lib/sh/strtol.c
	- include stdc.h before bashansi.h

execute_cmd.c
	- make sure that execute_cond_node treats `=' the same as `=='

				   8/25
				   ----
variables.c, print_cmd.c
	- changed some calls to itos to use inttostr instead

cross-build/x86-beos.cache, {execute_cmd,general,shell,trap}.c
	- some changes for BeOS (from fnf@ninemoons.com)

lib/posixheaders/memalloc.h
	- changes to handle case where we're using both gcc and the C
	  version of alloca(), or if we have alloca.h and we're using
	  the C version of alloca() (from fnf@ninemoons.com)

lib/sh/oslib.c
	- if bcopy or bzero are #defines, #undef them before defining
	  replacement functions

support/config.guess
	- recognize AmigaOS (from fnf@ninemoons.com)
	- recognize BeOS running on various machines
	  (from fnf@ninemoons.com)

support/config.sub
	- change basic_machine definition for amiga; added amigaos
	  (from fnf@ninemoons.com)
	- changed definitions for MIPS machines running Linux (from
	  fnf@ninemoons.com)
	- recognize `beos' as a valid operating system
	  (from fnf@ninemoons.com)
	- changed OS for *-cbm to `amigaos' rather than `amigados'
	  (from fnf@ninemoons.com)

examples/functions/autoload.v3
	- a new version, from Mark Kennedy <mtk@ny.ubs.com>

lib/readline/readline.c
	- new function, rl_delete_or_show_completions, like tcsh editing
	  function delete-char-or-list

lib/readline/readline.h
	- new extern declaration for rl_delete_or_show_completions

lib/readline/funmap.c
	- new bindable name `delete-char-or-list', like tcsh

lib/readline/doc/rluser.texinfo, doc/{bash.1,readline.3}
	- documented new delete-char-or-list command

general.c
	- fix full_pathname to keep it from generating things like
	  //foo when the current directory is /

				   8/27
				   ----
builtins/fc.def
	- fixed the help text for the -e option

				   8/28
				   ----
support/shobj-conf
	- added a clause for AIX 4.2 systems running gcc -- just the
	  standard gcc stuff for shared objects, but it has to come
	  before the other AIX 4.2 clause

				   8/31
				   ----
shell.c
	- some changes so that `set -e' is turned off while executing
	  the startup files

				    9/3
				    ---
flags.c
	- new variable, `restricted_shell', non-zero if the shell was
	  started in restricted mode

flags.h
	- extern declaration for restricted_shell

shell.c
	- new function, shell_is_restricted, returns 1 if the shell is
	  supposed to be restricted based on the basename of $0 or the
	  -r option
	- set restricted_shell to the value returned by shell_is_restricted
	  before executing the startup files

externs.h
	- extern declaration for shell_is_restricted

builtins/shopt.def
	- new shopt variable, restricted_shell, indicates whether the shell
	  was restricted at startup -- useful in startup files

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented new restricted_shell shopt option

				   9/15
				   ----
lib/sh/rename.c
	- new file, replacement for rename(2) if the OS doesn't provide it

configure.in,config.h.in,Makefile.in,lib/sh/Makefile.in
	- machinery for including rename.o in libsh.a

nojobs.c
	- make sure that set_tty_state returns a value

builtins/mkbuiltins.c
	- use a call to rename(2) instead of a link/unlink pair

lib/glob/glob.c
	- don't #define bcopy if bcopy is already defined

lib/readline/histfile.c
	- add a call to ftruncate for BeOS, which ignores the O_TRUNC flag
	  to open

lib/readline/input.c
	- make rl_getc loop if read returns -1/EINTR on BeOS

configure.in
	- set ARFLAGS and substitute it into the Makefiles

{,builtins,lib/{glob,malloc,readline,sh,termcap,tilde}}/Makefile.in
	- ARFLAGS is now substituted by configure
	- use ARFLAGS in rules that create libraries using $(AR)

builtins/printf.def
	- fixed bug that caused a core dump when a modifier was supplied
	  in the format string without a conversion character (e.g. `%h')

				   9/17
				   ----
lib/glob/glob.c
	- if filenames starting with a dot don't have to be matched
	  explicitly (e.g., after a `shopt -s dotglob'), don't match
	  `.' or `..' in any case

eval.c
	- make sure that array assignments don't show up in the history list
	  (fix from Andreas Schwab <schwab@issan.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>)

lib/readline/complete.c
	- fix to rl_menu_complete so it inserts a single completion properly
	  when a word matches only one filename

				   9/24
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- difftimeval should zero out the tv_usec field if the tv_sec field
	  is < 0
	- addtimeval should check for tv_usec being == 1000000 and add one
	  to tv_sec if it is

				   9/25
				   ----
subst.c
	- fix to expand_word_internal to prevent non-whitespace IFS characters
	  from causing word splitting if they are not the results of an
	  expansion (not exactly right yet, but I think it's the result of a
	  problem with the ${...} end-brace-matching code in the parser)

				   9/28
				   ----
parse.y
	- new flag for parse_matched_pair -- P_FIRSTCLOSE -- which makes it not
	  count and match additional construct open characters
	- change calls to parse_matched_pair when matching braces in
	  ${...} constructs (both unquoted and within double quotes) to
	  specify the P_FIRSTCLOSE flag to match POSIX.2 requirements

subst.c
	- changed fix from 9/25, now that the parser problem is fixed

				   9/30
				   ----
variables.c
	- change expansion of list of words between (...) in array assignments
	  to include pathname generation in assign_array_var_from_string

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- clarified behavior of the shell at startup if running setuid, with
	  and without the -p option supplied

				   10/7
				   ----
bashhist.c
	- change default open(2) mode to 0600 instead of 0666 for `privacy
	  concerns'

				   10/13
				   -----
lib/readline/display.c
	- fixed a problem with displaying tabs after newlines, from
	  <qrczak@knm.org.pl>
	- in update_line, if we are printing over existing material,
	  only call space_to_eol or _rl_clear_to_eol if lendiff is non-zero
	- when moving the cursor in _rl_move_cursor_relative, only call
	  _rl_backspace if the current cursor position is strictly greater
	  than the desired cursor position

				   10/14
				   -----
locale.c
	- LC_ALL is no longer set automatically when LANG is assigned a value

config.h.{top,bot}
	- renamed to config-{top,bot}.h, respectively

config.h.in
	- include config-top.h and config-bot.h

Makefile.in
	- things now depend on config-top.h and config-bot.h

subst.c
	- minor changes to extract_dollar_brace_string and char_is_quoted to
	  allow things like "${PIP[TAB] to perform correct variable completion

				   10/15
				   -----
builtins/Makefile.in
	- add $(PROFILE_FLAGS) to the make recipe that creates `mkbuiltins',
	  so configuring with --enable-profiling works right

				   10/20
				   -----
doc/bashref.texi
	- documented the new --with-installed-readline option

[bash-2.03-alpha1 frozen]

				   10/21
				   -----
builtins/reserved.def
	- fixed help text for { ... } to make it clear that a semicolon is
	  required before the closing brace

				   10/22
				   -----
trap.c
	- in decode_signal, don't bother calling strcasecmp if
	  signal_names[sig] is null or empty

				   11/2
				   ----
configure.in
	- make sure RL_LIBDIR and HIST_LIBDIR are assigned values even if
	  readline or history is configured out of the shell, so the -L
	  options have arguments in the link command

test.c
	- make test_syntax_error cause test to return a status > 1, to
	  conform to POSIX.2 4.62.8

doc/readline.3
	- make sure the SYNOPSIS section indicates that programmers should
	  include <stdio.h> before <readline.h>

				   11/9
				   ----
Makefile.in
	- install with explicit mode of 0755

				   11/10
				   -----
builtins/test.def
	- make sure that a missing `]' makes `[' exit with status 2, to
	  conform to POSIX.2 4.62.8

command.h
	- new word flag: W_NOGLOB, meaning to not perform globbing

execute_cmd.c
	- fix_assignment_statements now turns on the W_NOGLOB flag for
	  arguments to `assignment builtins' that have W_ASSIGNMENT set

subst.c
	- expand_word_internal needs to preserve the W_NOGLOB flag from
	  the word being expanded to the word being returned
	- glob_expand_word_list does not call shell_glob_filename for a
	  word with W_NOGLOB set

builtins/shopt.def
	- print_shopt is now void

configure.in
	- machines running Rhapsody don't use the bash malloc
	- pass host_vendor to the Makefiles with AC_SUBST

support/config.guess
	- Rhapsody is really rhapsody, not nextstep

support/config.sub
	- add rhapsody to the list of supported configurations

Makefile.in
	- pass CONF_HOSTTYPE, CONF_OSTYPE, and CONF_MACHTYPE as -D options
	  in SYSTEM_FLAGS, to indicate that they came from the configuration
	  process
	- set VENDOR variable from host_vendor configuration variable
	- pass CONF_VENDOR as part of SYSTEM_FLAGS

variables.c
	- define HOSTTYPE, OSTYPE, and MACHTYPE as CONF_HOSTTYPE, CONF_OSTYPE,
	  and CONF_MACHTYPE, respectively

				   11/11
				   -----
doc/{bashref.texi,bash.1}
	- updated description of `read' to clarify the -r option and its
	  effect on backslash escaping

				   11/13
				   -----
examples/loadables/{ln,unlink}.c
	- new loadable builtins

				   11/23
				   -----
lib/glob/fnmatch.c
	- some fixes to handle extended glob patterns immediately following
	  a `*'

tests/extglob.tests
	- updated with cases from bug report fixed today

support/shobj-conf
	- udpated stanza for aix 4.2 with gcc, based on information from
	  jik@cisco.com

configure.in
	- changes to add the correct linker options to allow dynamic linking
	  when using gcc on AIX 4.2, instead of insisting on the AIX C
	  compiler

examples/misc/aliasconv.{bash,sh}
	- changes to handle aliases with embedded single quotes

				   11/25
				   -----
lib/readline/complete.c
	- postprocess_matches should call compute_lcd_of_matches with an
	  argument of `t' instead of `text'
	- postprocess_matches should never call ding(); leave that for the
	  callers
	- postprocess_matches no longer needs `text' as the first argument
	- rl_complete_internal needs to call ding() if postprocess_matches
	  returns 0, since postprocess_matches no longer does it
	- rl_complete_internal can now free `text' immediately after calling
	  gen_completion_matches, since it's no longer used

				   11/30
				   -----
print_cmd.c
	- make sure redirections following compound commands have a space
	  separating them from the command

				   12/1
				   ----
general.c
	- changed canonicalize_pathname so that if the result path begins
	  with `//', it will be changed to `/' if and only if the original
	  path did not begin with `//' (there has to be a non-slash after
	  the leading `///' in the original path)

				   12/2
				   ----
builtins/evalstring.c
	- augment the test for turning on CMD_NO_FORK to make sure that
	  parse_and_execute_level == 1.  That takes care of things like

		bash -c 'for f in 1 2 3; do eval "/bin/echo \"$f\"" ; done'

	  only printing one line of output

				   12/8
				   ----
config-top.h
	- add commented-out #define for NON_INTERACTIVE_LOGIN_SHELLS so
	  that users may, if they choose, make things like

		#! /bin/bash --login

	  work in shell scripts

				   12/10
				   -----
jobs.c
	- changes to the way jobs are reaped when the shell is not
	  interactive:

		o notify_of_job_status no longer marks dead jobs as
		  notified if they did not exit due to a signal;
		o changed mark_background_jobs_as_notified to take an
		  argument `force':  if zero, we only mark enough
		  dead jobs as notified to keep CHILD_MAX jobs in the
		  jobs list, as POSIX.2 specifies.  If non-zero, mark
		  all dead jobs as notified;
		o wait_for_background_pids marks all dead jobs as
		  notified when it has finished waiting for everything,
		  since the only thing that calls it is the `wait' builtin;
		o wait_for_single_pid marks a job as notified after it
		  has completed, since the only things that call it are
		  wait_for_background_pids and the `wait' builtin
		o wait_for_job marks the job as notified after the last
		  pid completes

execute_cmd.c
	- change execute_subshell_builtin_or_function to check
	  subshell_environment and pipe_out to decide whether or not to fork
	  if builtin == jobs_builtin, since the early-forking code added in
	  bash-2.02 means that the piping has probably already been done

				   12/15
				   -----
parse.y
	- changes to make avar=((...)) a syntax error instead of ignoring
	  the nested parens and treating it as an array assignment

shell.c
	- changed run_startup_files so that any shell, whether or not it is
	  interactive, will run the login shell startup files when given the
	  --login option.  This happens only when not in posix mode.

builtins/enable.def
	- changes to handle Tenon's MachTen, whose dlclose() does not return
	  a value

lib/glob/fnmatch.c
	- changed gmatch so that when it calls extmatch, it removes FNM_PERIOD
	  from the flags if it's not matching at the start of the string.
	  This fixes the problem of `@' and `+' extended-glob subpatterns
	  containing bracket expressions treating `.' specially when matching
	  a portion of the string starting with `.'

config-top.h
	- removed define for NON_INTERACTIVE_LOGIN_SHELLS, since it's no longer
	  necessary

				   12/17
				   -----
lib/readline/complete.c
	- change rl_complete_internal and rl_menu_complete to check
	  rl_filename_completion_desired to decide whether or not we're
	  completing filenames instead of checking whether the attempted
	  completion function is filename_completion_function.
	  filename_completion_function sets rl_filename_completion_desired,
	  so this shouldn't break anything -- just allow postprocessing of
	  matches for user-supplied filename completion functions that don't
	  call filename_completion_function

lib/readline/display.c
	- new function, _rl_erase_entire_line, which erases the entire line,
	  no matter where the cursor is, and puts the cursor at the beginning
	  of the (newly-empty) line

lib/readline/readline.c
	- new application-level variable, rl_erase_empty_line, which, if
	  non-zero, tells readline to erase the contents of the current line,
	  prompt and all, if the only character typed to an otherwise-blank
	  line is bound to rl_newline.  Requested by the Cygnus GDB folks.
	- change to rl_newline to suppress the call to _rl_update_final if
	  rl_erase_empty_line is non-zero, and rl_point == rl_end == 0, since
	  _rl_update_final calls crlf()
	- change to readline_internal_charloop to call _rl_erase_entire_line
	  if newline was the only thing typed on an otherwise-empty line

lib/readline/readline.h
	- extern declaration for rl_erase_empty_line

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- documented new rl_erase_empty_line variable

				   12/18
				   -----
Makefile.in
	- changed RELSTATUS to `beta1'

[bash-2.03-beta1 frozen]

				   12/21
				   -----
doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- added description of `test -h'; equivalent to `test -L'

				   12/22
				   -----
support/shobj-conf
	- SHOBJ_LDFLAGS should be those options to ld which are common
	  between building dynamically loadable shared objects and shared
	  libraries
	- added two new variables: SHOBJ_XLDFLAGS, which are ld options
	  specific to building dynamically loaded shared objects, and
	  SHLIB_LIBS, which are other libraries against which shared libraries
	  should be linked.  These are for the benefit of AIX 4.2; other
	  stanzas do not need to be changed.

configure.in
	- add call to AC_SUBST for SHOBJ_XLDFLAGS

examples/loadables/Makefile.in
	- SHOBJ_XLDFLAGS is now substituted by configure
	- $(SHOBJ_LDFLAGS) -> $(SHOBJ_LDFLAGS) $(SHOBJ_XLDFLAGS) in all
	  recipes that build loadable builtins

				   12/29
				   -----
support/config.{guess,sub}
	- changes for NEC SX4 machines running SUPER-UX (?).  Info from
	  Nicholas Clark <nick@flirble.org>

lib/readline/bind.c
	- new bindable variable, `isearch-terminators', which is the list of
	  characters that will terminate an incremental search without
	  subsequently executing the character as a command

lib/readline/isearch.c
	- changes to incorporate the new isearch-terminators bindable variable;
	  uses new private readline variable _rl_isearch_terminators
	  (suggested by Brian Fox)

doc/{bash.1,readline.3}, lib/readline/doc/rluser.texinfo
	- documented new `isearch-terminators' settable variable

lib/readline/complete.c
	- new convenience function, free_match_list, called from
	  rl_complete_internal

				   12/30
				   -----
aclocal.m4
	- changed the calls to AC_MSG_ERROR in the cross-compiling sections
	  to AC_MSG_WARN, since AC_MSG_ERROR can cause configure to abort

examples/functions/which
	- new function, emulation of `which' as it appears in FreeBSD

				   12/31
				   -----
lib/readline/readline.c
	- new bindable function: rl_rubout_or_delete.  Does rl_rubout if
	  rl_point is at the end of the line, or rl_delete if not.  This
	  is intended to mimic the Motif/Netscape/GNOME behavior of the
	  DEL character, and can be bound to delete to get that behavior

lib/readline/readline.h
	- new extern declaration for rl_rubout_or_delete

lib/readline/funmap.c
	- bound the name `forward-backward-delete-char' to
	  rl_rubout_or_delete (currently not bound to any keys)

lib/readline/doc/manvers.texinfo
	- new file with readline manual version information, to mantain
	  consistent numbering between readline and history manuals

lib/readline/doc/{rlman,hist}.texinfo
	- @include manvers.texinfo for version information
	- moved the @dircategory and and @direntry directives inside
	  the @ifinfo block
	- changed copyrights to 1988-1999

doc/Makefile.in, lib/readline/doc/Makefile.in
	- texi2html is now called with -menu (to handle the texinfo menus)
	  and -monolithic (to include the table of contents in the generated
	  HTML file instead of putting it in a separate file
	- changed recipes to remove references to TOC html files

lib/glob/fnmatch.c
	- include <string.h> or <strings.h> as appropriate for strchr()
	  declaration

				 1/4/1999
				 --------
print_cmd.c
	- don't print bare words when printing conditional expressions in
	  print_cond_node, use cprintf("%s", cond->op->word)

subst.c
	- in separate_out_assignments, if VARLIST is non-null on function
	  entry, free it up to clean up after a previous error longjmp

				    1/5
				    ---
configure.in
	- make sure the case clause that disables the bash malloc on alpha
	  machines catches things like `alphaev56' as well as `alpha'

				   1/12
				   ----
lib/readline/histlib.h
	- new error message code: NO_PREV_SUBST

lib/readline/histexpand.c
	- handle NO_PREV_SUBST with appropriate error message in hist_error
	- in history_expand_internal, if the `s' or `&' case results in a
	  null or empty LHS, return NO_PREV_SUBST

error.c
	- new interface: command_error(func, code, e, flags); intended to
	  collect command-related errors in one place
	- new interface: command_errstr(code); returns a string describing
	  command error CODE

error.h
	- extern declarations for command_error and command_errstr

command.h
	- possible values for CODE in calls to command_error and command_errstr

{shell,print_cmd,make_cmd,execute_cmd,dispose_cmd,eval}.c ,builtins/evalstring.c
	- changed some calls to programming_error to use command_error

				   1/13
				   ----
configure.in
	- if --enable-profiling is specified on a solaris2 machine, don't
	  turn on enable-static-link, since it's very hard to build a
	  static binary on solaris2 and gprof does not (apparently) require it

builtins/getopts.def
	- add calls to sh_getopt_restore_state so the state is restored each
	  time getopts is called.  This protects us against the behavior of
	  some mallocs, which causes `nextchar' to be set to garbage in
	  getopt.c when a function is called between calls to getopts

				   1/14
				   ----
lib/readline/complete.c
	- if postprocess_matches returns 0 in rl_complete_internal, reset
	  completion_changed_buffer to 0 before returning, since nothing
	  has been changed

				   1/20
				   ----
subst.c
	- fixed pat_subst so that null patterns with a `#' specifier prefix
	  the string to be substituted on with the replacement, and null
	  patterns with a `%' specifier append the replacement to the string
	  to be substituted on

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- corrected a small error in the description of parameter pattern
	  substitution

support/mksignames.c
	- SIGINFO means something else on sequent systems

				   1/26

execute_cmd.c
	- fix to execute_simple_command to keep a child process from getting
	  a bad value of last_asynchronous_pid when the shell forks early

				    2/1
				    ---
Makefile.in
	- changed RELSTATUS to `beta2'

				    2/2
				    ---
[bash-2.03-beta2 released]

				    2/3
				    ---
tests/{cprint.{tests,right},run-cprint}
	- new test to exercise the command printing and copying code --
	  hopefully this will avoid things like the `conditional commands
	  in functions make the shell abort' problem

				    2/4
				    ---
version.c
	- if MACHTYPE is not defined, use CONF_MACHTYPE if it's defined

				    2/5
				    ---
builtins/read.def
	- if READLINE is defined, we need an extra pair of braces around
	  the `while' loop that reads from fd 0 if the -e option is
	  supplied, otherwise the code erroneously tests the value of
	  `retval', which is not set when using readline

				   2/15
				   ----
builtins/fc.def
	- make sure that fc closes `stream' before calling fc_execute_file

				   2/17
				   ----
builtins/fc.def
	- don't bother opening and closing the file of commands before
	  calling fc_execute_file, since parse_and_execute will write the
	  commands to the history file for us

Makefile.in
	- changed release status to `release'

				   2/18
				   ----
parse.y
	- change to special_case_tokens so that `time' is not recognized
	  as a reserved word while the parser is parsing a case statement
	  pattern list (if `time' is the first pattern, the last read
	  token will be newline, which time_command_acceptable says is OK
	  to start a pipeline)

pathexp.c
	- some changes to the POSIX_GLOB_LIBRARY code (often unused)

shell.c
	- a couple of changes for Interix (nee OPENNT)
	- added code that handles systems without a third argument to main();
	  initializing `env' from `environ', conditionalized on a cpp define
	  NO_MAIN_ENV_ARG

configure.in, config.h.in
	- check for the presence of sbrk(2); define HAVE_SBRK if found

xmalloc.c
	- don't do the space allocated computation when malloc or realloc
	  fails if HAVE_SBRK is not defined

configure.in
	- new configure variable, MAKE_SHELL, defaults to /bin/sh

Makefile.in,{builtins,doc,support,lib/{glob,malloc,readline,sh,termcap,tilde},examples/loadables}/Makefile.in
	- set SHELL from @MAKE_SHELL@

lib/posixheaders/posixjmp.h
	- Don't override defines for setjmp and longjmp in <setjmp.h> on
	  Internix (nee OPENNT)

lib/readline/complete.c
	- Interix (OPENNT) doesn't do username completion

configure.in
	- on Interix/OPENNT ($host_os == interix* or opennt*), add
	  -DNO_MAIN_ENV_ARG to LOCAL_CFLAGS
	- on Interix/OPENNT, set MAKE_SHELL to $OPENNT_ROOT/bin/sh rather
	  than a straight /bin/sh

cross-build/opennt.cache
	- a `configure' cache file for Interix/OPENNT; not necessarily
	  for cross-compiling, but this is where the other system cache
	  files are

[bash-2.03 released]

				   2/19
				   ----
configure.in
	- changed OPENNT_ROOT to INTERIX_ROOT for building on Interix

support/config.guess
	- added two stanzas for Interix running on alpha and intel hardware

				   2/22
				   ----
config-bot.h
	- if PROMPT_STRING_DECODE is not defined, #undef PPROMPT before
	  redefining it, to avoid warning messages

execute_cmd.c
	- set jobs_hack in execute_subshell_builtin_or_function only if
	  JOB_CONTROL is defined

				   2/24
				   ----
trap.c
	- fixed an obscure bug caused by a race condition in run_pending_traps.
	  Read the comments in the source code for a full description of the
	  problem and solution

				    3/1
				    ---
aclocal.m4
	- new test, BASH_STRUCT_TIMEVAL, which tries to compile a code
	  fragment that includes <sys/time.h> and <time.h> as appropriate
	  and defines HAVE_TIMEVAL if the compile succeeds

configure.in
	- call BASH_STRUCT_TIMEVAL rather than running a pair of
	  AC_HEADER_EGREPs on sys/time.h and time.h

lib/readline/histfile.c
	- include "posixstat.h" rather than <sys/stat.h>
	- in history_truncate_file, only try to truncate if the history file
	  is a regular file

				    3/2
				    ---
aclocal.m4
	- changed BASH_STRUCT_TIMEVAL back to using a pair of
	  AC_EGREP_HEADERs instead of compiling a program fragment

lib/readline/readline.c
	- readline_internal_charloop should cast the first argument to
	  _rl_dispatch to `unsigned char' to avoid problems with negative
	  array indices on systems where signed chars are the default

lib/readline/kill.c
	- instead of doing a sequence of next_history() calls in
	  rl_yank_nth_arg_internal, save and restore the history
	  position explicitly after finding the correct entry.  This
	  attempts to ensure that rl_yank_nth_arg leaves the history
	  pointer set to the same position as when it was called.
	  Fix from Vasco Pedro <vp@di.fct.unl.pt>

				    3/5
				    ---
redir.c
	- broke code that opens file for redirection in do_redirection_internal
	  into a separate function: redir_open(path, flags, mode, ri)

general.h
	- changed STREQN so that it evaluates to 1 (strings are equivalent)
	  if N == 0, to match the behavior of strncmp

lib/sh/zwrite.c
	- new file, zwrite() from builtins/evalstring.c

builtins/evalstring.c
	- removed private definition of zwrite

builtins/common.c
	- double_quote needs to protect newlines with backslashes as well
	- new function, un_double_quote, to remove backslashes proctecting
	  characters that are special in double quotes

builtins/common.h
	- new extern declaration for un_double_quote

parse.y
	- changed read_token_word to requote the expanded value of $'...'
	  using single_quote
	- added a new flag to parse_matched_pair: P_ALLOWESC.  It allows
	  backslashes to quote embedded single quotes, and is used by
	  the $'...' translation code for better ksh93-compatibility
	- changed localeexpand to call mk_msgstr on the string passed
	  before displaying it if all we're doing is displaying translatable
	  strings in `po' format.  mk_msgstr quotes backslashes and double
	  quotes in the string passed with backslashes, and encloses the
	  result in double quotes.  If only -D is supplied, the string is
	  not changed at all -- this is what ksh93 does

lib/readline/rlconf.h
	- removed PAREN_MATCHING #define, paren matching is always compiled
	  into readline

lib/readline/parens.c
	- removed code that was active if PAREN_MATCHING was not defined
	- added _rl_enable_paren_matching, which is called when the readline
	  variable `blink-matching-paren' is assigned a value and changes
	  the appropriate key bindings in emacs_standard_keymap

lib/readline/bind.c
	- no more PAREN_MATCHING defines, `blink-matching-paren' is always
	  available
	- if `blink-matching-paren' is assigned a value, call
	  _rl_enable_paren_matching (rl_blink_matching_paren)

lib/readline/emacs_keymap.c
	- removed PAREN_MATCHING defines; the default key bindings for
	  ), ], and } are self-insert

				    3/7
				    ---
stringlib.c
	- added an extra argument to ansicstr so that `echo -e' will not
	  convert \' to '

externs.h
	- changed extern declaration for ansicstr

parse.y, builtins/{echo,printf}.def
	- changed calls to ansicstr() appropriately

eval.c
	- in parse_string_to_word_list, if an unexpected token is encountered
	  that causes the string to not parse to a simple command, or to
	  completely consume the string, display an error message and jump
	  back to the top level after restoring the parsing environment,
	  returning an error status from the attempted assignment

				    3/8
				    ---
lib/glob/fnmatch.c
	- fixed patscan and extmatch to handle embedded [...](...) patterns
	  better

tests/{extglob2.{tests,right},run-extglob2}
	- an additional set of ksh extended globbing tests, cribbed from zsh

				   3/10
				   ----
general.c
	- changed unset_nodelay_mode slightly to make sure it handles both
	  O_NDELAY and O_NONBLOCK if they have different values; it now
	  returns a value of 0 on success (or no action); -1 on failure

general.h
	- changed extern declaration for unset_nodelay_mode


lib/readline/shell.c
	- new function: unset_nodelay_mode; identical to definition in
	  general.c

lib/readline/input.c
	- changed rl_getc to call unset_nodelay_mode if the read fails with
	  errno == EWOULDBLOCK || errno == EAGAIN

				   3/11
				   ----
lib/termcap/termcap.c
	- minor changes from termutils-2.0
	- minor change to MS-DOS version of valid_filename_p so MS-DOS-specific
	  code from tgetent() can be removed (from Michel@smr.nl)

lib/readline/bind.c
	- in _rl_read_file, null-terminate the buffer at the number of
	  characters actually read, not what stat() says the file size is
	- use ~/_inputrc as a last-ditch inputrc filename on MS-DOS

lib/readline/complete.c
	- change printable_part to handle MS-DOS `drive-letter:' pathname
	  prefixes
	- removed __GO32__ code, since it's for DJGPP 1.x, which is not
	  supported any more, and they don't work for DJGPP 2.x
	- added code to support MS-DOS drive letter prefixes and //X/...
	  to filename_completion_function
	- _rl_completion_case_fold defaults to 1 on MS-DOS

lib/readline/{display,input,readline,rltty,signals,terminal}.c
	- removed __GO32__ code

lib/readline/histfile.c
	- make read_history_range and history_truncate_file work with the
	  actual number of characters read from the file, not the file size
	  as reported by stat()

lib/readline/readline.c
	- change bind_arrow_keys_internal to bind MS-DOS arrow keys to the
	  appropriate functions if __MSDOS__ is defined

lib/readline/rltty.c
	- make sure set_winsize is always defined, with a null body if
	  TIOCGWINSZ is not defined

lib/readline/shell.c
	- include <stdio.h>, since this file uses sprintf

support/shobj-conf
	- MS-DOS does not support shared objects

lib/tilde/tilde.c
	- change tilde_find_suffix and isolate_tilde_prefix to understand
	  backslash as a pathname separator on MS-DOS

				   3/12
				   ----
lib/readline/{bind,readline,terminal}.c
	- no longer need to include <signal.h>

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- don't need to include <setjmp.h>

builtins/history.def
	- broke the code than handles deleting a particular history entry
	  from the history list out into a separate function: delete_histent
	- added `-d offset' option to delete the history entry at position
	  OFFSET, as displayed when the history is listed

jobs.c, nojobs.c
	- new function, count_all_jobs(), returns the number of active jobs
	  in the jobs list

jobs.h
	- extern declaration for count_all_jobs()

configure.in
	- check for C library function ttyname()

config.h.in
	- define HAVE_TTYNAME if configure finds ttyname(3)

parse.y
	- two new escape sequences for decode_prompt_string:

		\j	number of active jobs in jobs list
		\l	basename of shell's tty device name

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}, lib/readline/doc/hsuser.texi
	- documented new `history -d' option
	- documented new \j and \l prompt string expansion sequences

lib/readline/bind.c
	- new static state variable, currently_reading_init_file, set to
	  1 while _rl_read_init_file is operating on a file
	- changed _rl_init_file_error to include the name and line number
	  from the init file only if currently_reading_init_file is non-zero
	  (this is needed since applications like bash can call
	  rl_parse_and_bind, and error messages from those calls would be
	  misleading if they referred to the last inputrc file read

bashline.c
	- support for a `extended command keymap', which will allow
	  readline key sequences to be bound to unix commands using an
	  auxiliary keymap and a special function that knows how to execute
	  commands from it
	- bind_keyseq_to_unix_command supports `bind -x'
	- bash_execute_unix_command is the readline callback that looks in
	  an auxiliary keymap to find the shell command to execute for a
	  particular key sequence
	- new variable, no_empty_command_completion, which suppresses $PATH
	  searching for command completion when TAB is typed on an empty
	  line

bashline.h
	- extern declaration for new function bind_keyseq_to_unix_command

builtins/bind.def
	- added `-x' option to bind a key sequence to a shell command

builtins/help.def
	- added `-s' option to just print a builtin's short_doc

builtins/shopt.def
	- added new shell option, no_empty_cmd_completion', mirroring value
	  of no_empty_command_completion

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented new `bind -x' option
	- documented new shopt `no_empty_cmd_completion' option
	- documented new `help -s' option

Makefile.in
	- changed RELSTATUS to `devel'

_distribution
	- changed to `2.04'

				   3/15
				   ----
support/shobj-conf
	- add `-h $@' to linking options on Solaris 2 with gcc

expr.c
	- changes to add {pre,post}-{inc,dec}rement operators (++id, --id,
	  id++, id--).  These are somewhat more liberal than ksh93, and
	  may require more strict syntax checking down the line

tests/arith.{tests,right}
	- additional tests for {pre,post}-{inc,dec}rement operators

				   3/16
				   ----
command.h
	- structures and types for ksh-93-style arithmetic `for' command

configure.in
	- new `--enable-arith-for-command' option to compile arithmetic for
	  command code into the shell

config.h.in
	- new define, ARITH_FOR_COMMAND, turned on by configure

parse.y
	- changed read_token_word to parse a set of arithmetic for expressions
	  between (( and )) as long as the last token read before the `(('
	  was FOR
	- added grammar rules to build arithmetic for commands

make_cmd.c
	- functions to parse (( ... )) into the three sub-expressions needed
	  for the arithmetic for command and create the command structures
	  (done this way instead of in the grammar rules to avoid forcing
	  users to quote special characters between the (( and )) )

make_cmd.h
	- extern declaration for make_arith_for_command

copy_cmd.c
	- code to copy arithmetic for commands

dispose_cmd.c
	- code to dispose of arithmetic for commands

print_cmd.c
	- code to print arithmetic for commands

execute_cmd.c
	- code to execute arithmetic for commands and note that they are
	  shell control structures for the piping code

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	 - documented new arithmetic for command

doc/bashref.texi
	- documented new configure --enable-arith-for-command option

				   3/17
				   ----
builtins/read.def
	- added `-t timeout' option and code to support it

				   3/18
				   ----
examples/loadables/Makefile.in
	- various clean targets need to descend into perl

examples/loadables/perl/Makefile.in
	- added mostlyclean and maintainer-clean targets

include
	- new directory, with files from lib/posixheaders

lib/posixheaders
	- removed

{posixwait,unionwait,maxpath}.h
	- moved from top src directory to include subdir

Makefile.in,builtins/Makefile.in,lib/{glob,malloc,sh,tilde}/Makefile.in
	- updated dependencies and file lists for new include directory
	- added BASHINCDIR variable, added -I${BASHINCDIR} to cc's include path

MANIFEST,support/SYMLINKS
	- updated for new include directory

lib/readline/{ansi_stdlib,posixdir,posixjmp,posixstat,rlstdc}.h
	- changed symlinks to point to ../../include rather than
	  ../posixheaders

builtins/common.h
	- changed `#include "../stdc.h"' to `#include "stdc.h"'

builtins/{cd,exec,fc,history,pushd,source,type,umask,printf}.def
builtins/{mkbuiltins,common,evalfile,evalstring,getopt}.c
	- changed include specifications:
		../posixstat.h -> posixstat.h
		../filecntl.h -> filecntl.h
		../maxpath.h -> maxpath.h
		../memalloc.h -> memalloc.h

include/shtty.h
	- new file, contents of bashtty.h and code from jobs.c that includes
	  the appropriate terminal file

lib/sh/shtty.c
	- new file with some tty manipulation utility functions

bashtty.h
	- removed

jobs.c, nojobs.c
	- include shtty.h instead of bashty.h and other code that includes
	  the correct system-dependent tty include file

lib/sh/Makefile.in
	- added shtty.o as part of libsh.a

MANIFEST
	- added include/shtty.h and lib/sh/shtty.c, removed bashtty.h

				   3/19
				   ----
lib/readline/display.c
	- some more __MSDOS__ code to make readline work better with DJGPP:
		output \r instead of tputs(term_cr, ...)

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- some changes for __DJGPP__ (one is of dubious value -- doesn't
	  DJGPP have a termcap library?)

				   3/23
				   ----
configure.in
	- make sure that the $CC argument to shobj-conf is quoted

support/shobj-conf
	- changes to SGI SHOBJ_LDFLAGS from David Kaelbling <drk@sgi.com>

				   3/24
				   ----
lib/sh/zread.c
	- interface to read(2) that restarts automatically if errno == EINTR

externs.h
	- new declarations for functions in lib/sh/{zread,zwrite}.c

lib/sh/Makefile.in, Makefile.in
	- add zread.c, zread.o to appropriate file lists

{subst,input}.c, builtins/{evalstring.c,read.def}
	- converted some loops around read() to call zread() instead

lib/readline/rltty.h
	- new struct _rl_tty_chars to save tty special characters

lib/readline/rltty.c
	- new function save_tty_chars to save tty special characters
	  (currently they're only saved -- nothing looks at them yet)
	- two new internal library functions, _rl_disable_tty_signals ()
	  and _rl_restore_tty_signals (), intended to disable tty driver
	  signal processing for readline's literal-next code, so users
	  can do stuff like ^V^C and have ^C end up in the readline
	  buffer even if ^C is the terminal's interrupt character

lib/readline/readline.c
	- changed rl_quoted_insert to disable and restore tty signal
	  handling around the call to rl_read_key (), so users can put
	  tty special chars into the readline buffer

				   3/25
				   ----
expr.c
	- added `,' operator (expr1 , expr2) -- both expr1 and expr2 are
	  evaluated and the return value is the value of expr2.  Precedence
	  is higher than assignment (which makes it highest)
	- make `lasttp' (pointer to last token) part of the expression
	  context that is saved and restored by {push,pop}_context.  This
	  is used only in error reporting

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented new `,' arithmetic operator
	- cleaned up some of the language concerning variables referenced
	  by name within an arithmetic expression

lib/readline/readline.c
	- new application-settable variable, rl_num_chars_to_read, which, if
	  set to a non-zero value, causes readline to return after reading
	  that many characters (or at least that many characters, if
	  rl_startup_hook is used to prime the input buffer) rather than
	  when reading a character bound to accept-line

lib/readline/readline.h
	- extern declaration for rl_num_chars_to_read

builtins/read.def
	- added new `-n nchars' option to read NCHARS from stdin rather than
	  a complete line.  Works both with and without using readline

doc/{bash.1,builtins.texi}
	- documented new `read -n nchars' option

				   3/26
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- make sure all uses of PIDs are of type pid_t

redir.c
	- broke stdin_redirects into two functions: stdin_redirection, which
	  checks a single redirection specification, and a new stdin_redirects,
	  which does what it did before but calls stdin_redirection for each
	  redirection in the chain

				   3/29
				   ----
aclocal.m4
	- new test, BASH_CHECK_DEV_STDIN, checks for /dev/stdin.  If it's
	  present HAVE_DEV_STDIN is defined and it's assumed that /dev/stdout
	  and /dev/stderr are present as well

configure.in
	- call BASH_CHECK_DEV_STDIN

config.h.in
	- add HAVE_DEV_STDIN, initially undefined

test.c
	- add /dev/std{in,out,err} to the special filenames that are handled
	  by test_stat() if HAVE_DEV_STDIN is not defined

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented conditional expressions' handling of /dev/std{in,out,err}

stringlib.c
	- new function, find_string_in_alist, to find (or match as an extended
	  glob pattern) a string in a STRING_INT_ALIST and return the
	  associated token value

externs.h
	- extern declaration for find_string_in_alist

redir.c
	- new STRING_INT_ALIST list of filenames the redirection code handles
	  specially (_redir_special_filenames)
	- new function, redir_special_open () to handle filenames found in
	  _redir_special_filenames (framework for /dev/tcp and /dev/udp, but
	  those are not implemented get)

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented special filename handling in redirections

				   3/30
				   ----
builtins/read.def
	- added `-d delim' option, like ksh93, to read until delim rather
	  than newline

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented new read `-d delim' option

configure.in
	- look for gethostbyname(3), inet_aton(3)
	- look for <netdb.h> and <netinet/in.h>
	- call BASH_FUNC_GETHOSTBYNAME if gethostbyname(3) is not in libc
	- check for u_int and u_long types, default to `unsigned int' and
	  `unsigned long' respectively
	- new enable option `--enable-net-redirections' to compile in the
	  /dev/tcp and /dev/udp redirection code

aclocal.m4
	- new macro, BASH_FUNC_GETHOSTBYNAME, looks for gethostbyname(3) in
	  the socket libraries if it's not found in libc

config.h.in
	- new defines: HAVE_GETHOSTBYNAME, HAVE_INET_ATON, HAVE_NETDB_H,
	  HAVE_NETINET_IN_H, NETWORK_REDIRECTIONS
	- new defines: u_int, u_long

lib/sh/inet_aton.c
	- new file, from GNU libc, slightly modified to remove inet_addr()

lib/sh/netopen.c
	- new file, functions to create tcp/udp network connections.  Exports
	  a single function: netopen(pathname)

externs.h
	- extern declaration for netopen()

lib/sh/Makefile.in, Makefile.in, MANIFEST
	- added appropriate references to inet_aton.c and netopen.c

config-bot.h
	- if HAVE_SYS_SOCKET_H, HAVE_GETPEERNAME, and HAVE_NETINET_IN_H are
	  all defined, define HAVE_NETWORK

redir.c
	- call netopen for pathnames of the form /dev/(tcp|udp)/host/port
	  if HAVE_NETWORK is defined; print a warning message otherwise
	- /dev/tcp and /dev/udp code is only compiled in if
	  NETWORK_REDIRECTIONS is defined

				   3/31
				   ----
lib/sh/zread.c
	- new function, zsyncfd(fd) which syncs the kernel's seek pointer on
	  FD with the last character returned by zreadc()

externs.h
	- extern declaration for zsyncfd

builtins/read.def
	- use zreadc if the input is not unbuffered (this cuts the number
	  of read(2) calls *way* down)
	- if input is not unbuffered, call zsyncfd before returning to make
	  sure zreadc's buffering doesn't consume too much input

shell.c
	- make want_pending_command and read_from_stdin global rather than

flags.c
	- change which_set_flags to insert `c' and `s' if the `-c' and `-s'
	  invocation options, respectively, were supplied at shell startup

bashline.c
	- change bash_directory_completion_hook to change the logic for
	  deciding whether or not to parameter expand the directory name --
	  now we expand only if there's a `$' (still has problems if the
	  user quoted the `$') or a `` pair.  Fixes bug reported by
	  chuckjr@sinclair.net.  To fix the `$' problem, could possibly
	  check what the user typed with rl_line_buffer and start, end
	  parameters to gen_completion_matches
	- changed attempt_shell_completion to slightly adjust the logic for
	  deciding whether or not a word is in a command position:  if the
	  word being completed has a single opening single or double quote
	  before the command separator, treat it as a candidate for (quoted)
	  command word completion
	- now that we understand partially-quoted strings as completion
	  candidates, we can do command completion on certain unclosed
	  uses of $(...

subst.c
	- change extract_delimited_string to not return an error for an
	  unclosed construct if DOING_COMPLETION is non-zero

	- fixed `ss=09 ; let ss=10' bug by introducing one-token lookahead
	  after a string token is parsed.  If the next token is `=', we
	  don't evaluate the variable's value as an expression, since it's
	  not going to be used

variables.h
	- added new member to struct variable: exportstr -- for the future
	  caching of strings to be placed into the environment
	- extern declaration for bind_variable_value

variables.c
	- make sure that the `exportstr' member of a struct variable is
	  initialized correctly, and put code in to free it where appropriate
	  (if non-null)
	- new function, bind_variable_value(VAR, VALUE); make shell variable
	  VAR have value VALUE
	- make sure var->exportstr is invalidated when a variable or function
	  is assigned a value

builtins/declare.def
	- call bind_variable_value instead of duplicating some of bind_variable
	  inline

				    4/6
				    ---
variables.h
	- new macros, VSETATTR and VUNSETATTR to set and clear variable
	  attributes

builtins{read,set,setattr,declare}.def,{execute_cmd,expr,shell,subst,variables}.c
	- change to use VSETATTR and VUNSETATTR

				    4/7
				    ---
doc/Makefile.in
	- if htmldir is set by configure, install the html files into that
	  directory with `make install' and remove them with `make uninstall'

Makefile.in,doc/Makefile.in
	- htmldir is set by configure and passed from the Makefile to the
	  install in the doc subdirectory

configure.in
	- substitute `htmldir' into Makefiles

support/config.guess
	- some small changes for Apple's Rhapsody

lib/termcap/Makefile.in
	- make the `distclean' and `maintainer-clean' targets remove Makefile

lib/termcap/ltcap.h
	- new private library include file, for Rhapsody __private_extern__
	  define

lib/termcap/{termcap,tparam}.c
	- include "ltcap.h"
	- if HAVE_CONFIG_H is defined, include <stdlib.h> if HAVE_STDLIB_H is
	  defined, otherwise declare getenv, malloc, realloc as extern
	- add __private_extern__ qualifier for extern data that Rhapsody
	  requires

shell.c
	- don't run the startup files in the rshd case if shell_level is >= 2
	  This should catch the case of
		rsh machine bash -c 'echo a'
	  running the .bashrc twice, once for the shell started by rshd and
	  one for the shell running -c command

				    4/8
				    ---
variables.c
	- in initialize_shell_variables, unset the export attribute from
	  SSH_CLIENT if it exists and we got it from the initial environment

shell.c
	- don't bother unsetting export attribute from SSH_CLIENT, since we
	  now do it in initialize_shell_variables

lib/readline/display.c
	- don't check prompt_this_line[-2] in rl_redisplay if prompt_this_line
	  isn't at least 2 characters after the start of rl_display_prompt

lib/readline/histfile.c
	- change the name of the default history file to _history on MS-DOS

lib/readline/histlib.h
	- add an extern declaration for history_offset

Makefile.in
	- add $(RL_LIBSRC)/xmalloc, $(RL_LIBSRC)/rlprivate.h,
	  $(RL_LIBSRC)/rlshell.h to READLINE_SOURCE variable

lib/readline/{bind,complete,display,funmap,histexpand,histfile,history,input,
isearch,keymaps,kill,macro,readline,search,shell,util,vi_mode}.c
	- include "xmalloc.h" rather than extern declarations for xmalloc,
	  xrealloc, xfree

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- new function, used in two places, _emx_get_screensize for EMX

lib/readline/readline.c
	- EMX apparently no longer needs _emx_build_environ

lib/readline/signals.c
	- support for __EMX__ in rl_signal_handler
	- don't set the old handler passed to rl_set_sighandler to
	  rl_signal_handler, because that would cause infinite recursion if
	  that signal were generated

lib/readline/xmalloc.c
	- no longer the same as lib/malloc/xmalloc.c, which is no longer
	  used by anyone
	- changes to include xmalloc.h, define READLINE_LIBRARY, change
	  some of the argument types

lib/tilde/tilde.c
	- add prototypes for extern function declarations if __STDC__
	  defined

lib/readline/{terminal,bind,readline,nls,histexpand}.c

lib/readline/{bind,callback,complete,display,input,isearch,kill,macro,nls,
parens,readline,rltty,search,signals,terminal,util,vi_mode}.c
	- include "rlprivate.h"
	- remove extern declarations already in rlprivate.h

xmalloc.c
	- xfree should take a PTR_T as its argument

general.h
	- change prototype for xfree to use void * instead of char *

lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- define PTR_T like it is defined in general.h
	- malloc() returns a PTR_T
	- free() takes a PTR_T as its argument
	- realloc() returns a PTR_T and takes a PTR_T as its first argument
	- memalign returns a PTR_T
	- valloc returns a PTR_T
	- calloc returns a PTR_T
	- cfree() takes a PTR_T

variables.c
	- new function: char **all_variables_matching_prefix (char *prefix)

variables.h
	- extern declaration for all_variables_matching_prefix

bashline.c
	- converted variable_completion_function to use
	  all_variables_matching_prefix

stringlib.c
	- new function, char **alloc_array(n), allocates an argv-style
	  array of strings with room for N members

externs.h
	- extern declaration for alloc_array

				   4/13
				   ----
lib/readline/keymaps.c
	- include "readline.h"
	- remove extern function declarations

include/stdc.h
	- break the definition of __P out from a strict __STDC__ block,
	  since __GNUC__ and __cplusplus also indicate that prototypes
	  are available

lib/readline/readline.h
	- adjust conditional declaration of rl_message, since __cplusplus
	  indicates that prototypes are available

lib/readline/rlstdc.h
	- private copy, modified, no longer symlinked to ../../include/stdc.h
	- __P is defined if __GNUC__ or __cplusplus is defined
	- removed defines for __STRING, const, inline, signed, volatile, since
	  readline does not use them

lib/readline/{search,readline}.c
	- extern declaration for _rl_free_history_entry with prototypes,
	  since it's not in rlprivate.h

lib/readline/history.h
	- added some missing `extern's in function declarations

lib/readline/undo.c
	- include "rlprivate.h"

lib/readline/shell.c
	- include "rlshell.h"

lib/readline/Makefile.in
	- update dependencies for undo.c, shell.c

lib/tilde/tilde.h
	- add #define for __P if not already defined
	- use prototypes in extern function declarations with __P()

lib/readline/doc/rluserman.texinfo
	- new file, derived from rlman.texinfo

{bashline,findcmd,general,pathexp}.c, builtins/getopts.def
	- call alloc_array(N) instead of (char **)xmalloc (N * sizeof (char *))

subst.c
	- added code to implement ksh-93 ${!prefix*} expansion

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented new ${!prefix*} expansion

				   4/15
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- new variable, this_shell_function, points to SHELL_VAR of currently
	  executing shell function

variables.c
	- new dynamic variable, FUNCNAME -- invisible when not executing shell
	  function

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented new FUNCNAME variable

				   4/16
				   ----
support/rlvers.sh
	- add -T option to specify correct termcap library

configure.in
	- Irix 4.x still needs to link with -lsun if it contains a replacement
	  getpwent function that works with NIS
	- if we're configuring with an already-installed readline library,
	  call BASH_CHECK_LIB_TERMCAP and pass the resulting $TERMCAP_LIB to
	  support/rlvers.sh

lib/readline/readline.c
	- in rl_forward, if rl_point ends up being < 0, set it to 0

lib/readline/exammples/excallback.c
	- new callback example code, from `Jeff Solomon <jsolomon@stanford.edu>'

lib/sh/getcwd.c
	- define NULL as 0 if not defined by one of the standard include files
	- cast result of malloc and realloc to (char *) where appropriate

variables.c
	- new functions for use by dynamic variables: null_assign and
	  null_array_assign.  Used as assign_func for a particular variable,
	  they cause assignments to that variable to be silently ignored
	- FUNCNAME and GROUPS are no longer readonly
	- FUNCNAME changed to use null_assign
	- GROUPS changed to use null_array_assign.  This means that the
	  variable can be unset if desired (like for Oracle startup scripts),
	  but cannot be assigned to

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- added text about assignments being silently discarded to descriptions
	  of FUNCNAME and GROUPS
	- removed text saying that GROUPS is readonly
	- added standard text about GROUPS being unset and losing its special
	  properties, even if reset

command.h
	- new command type, cm_subshell, actually causes the shell to fork
	  and then executes the command in the SUBSHELL_COM struct

parse.y
	- ( ... ) now creates a command of type cm_subshell, with the same
	  flag CMD_WANT_SUBSHELL as previous

make_cmd.c
	- new function make_subshell_command

make_cmd.h
	- extern declaration for make_subshell_command

dispose_cmd.c
	- code to destroy a SUBSHELL_COM

copy_cmd.c
	- code to duplicate a SUBSHELL_COM

print_cmd.c
	- code to print a SUBSHELL_COM

execute_cmd.c
	- broke the code that handles executing commands in subshells out of
	  execute_command_internal into a new function, execute_in_subshell,
	  with the same arguments
	- executing a command of type cm_subshell is just a slightly special
	  case, handled in execute_in_subshell

				   4/18
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- changed code in execute_command_internal that executes subshell
	  commands to check for command->type == cm_subshell in addition to
	  checking that commmand->flags & CMD_WANT_SUBSHELL is non-zero
	- changed execute_in_subshell to set the CMD_NO_FORK flag on the
	  command to be executed by a command of type cm_subshell
	  (command->value.Subshell->command), if that command is a simple
	  command (type == cm_simple) or a nested subshell (type == cm_subshell)
	  and is not being timed
	- changed execute_command_internal to just call and return the value
	  returned by execute_in_subshell if it gets a command of type
	  cm_subshell with flags including CMD_NO_FORK

lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- morecore() should always return through morecore_done, not with a
	  simple `return'

				   4/20
				   ----
variables.c
	- new function, quote_array_assignment_chars, backslash quotes all
	  `[' and `]' before an `=' in a word that's part of the body of a
	  compound array assignment.  Needed because we run the list through
	  the globbing code now.  Don't bother if `=' does not appear in
	  the string or if the first char is not `['
	- call quote_array_assignment_chars from assign_array_var_from_string
	  now

eval.c
	- moved parse_string_to_word_list to parse.y

parse.y
	- moved parse_string_to_word_list here.  Much simpler -- no longer
	  tries to parse a command, but just reads tokens using read_token().
	  Any token but a WORD or ASSIGNMENT_WORD causes a syntax error.
	  Don't have to mess around with saving global_command or calling
	  parse_command, but do need to save and restore the history stuff,
	  so the array assignment doesn't get saved on the history list

				   4/21
				   ----
nojobs.c
	- changed to use functions in lib/sh/shtty.c (tt{get,set}attr) for
	  the terminal attributes
	- added a `flags' field to struct proc_status, flags are PROC_RUNNING
	  and PROC_NOTIFIED (status has been returned to `wait')
	- functions check flags & PROC_RUNNING to check whether or not a
	  particular process is still alive; PROC_RUNNING is reset by
	  set_pid_status
	- new function, mark_dead_jobs_as_notified, same function as the one
	  in jobs.c
	- cleanup_dead_jobs reaps jobs only if they're dead and not marked
	  as notified
	- wait_for_background pids marks all pids as notified and reaps them
	  before it returns, since it's called by the `wait' builtin
	- wait_for_single_pid marks the pid being waited for as notified so
	  its slot can be reclaimed -- it's only called by the `wait' builtin
	- new function, process_exit_status, to turn what wait(2) takes into
	  an exit status

				   4/22
				   ----
nojobs.c
	- add_pid takes a new second argument, async_p, which is non-zero if
	  the process is in the background
	- new flag, PROC_ASYNC, set by add_pid
	- set_pid_status now sets the PROC_NOTIFIED flag if PROC_ASYNC is unset,
	  so foreground jobs get cleaned up right away
	- changed mark_dead_jobs_as_notified to take a `force' argument; if
	  non-zero, it marks only enough dead jobs to make the number of
	  un-notified dead jobs < CHILD_MAX
	- new function, reap_dead_jobs, same as in jobs.c

execute_cmd.c
	- don't need separate cases for REAP any more

				   4/23
				   ----
builtins/printf.def
	- new function, tescape, which processes a single backslash
	  escape sequence and returns the number of characters consumed by
	  the argument string (code taken from bexpand)
	- changed bexpand to call tescape rather than do backslash-escape
	  sequence conversion itself
	- changed occurrences of `illegal' in error messages to `invalid'
	- printf no longer calls ansicstr to translate backslash-escape
	  sequences; the mainline printf code now calls tescape whenever it
	  hits a backslash

				   4/26
				   ----
subst.c
	- new variable, garglist, set to list of words to be expanded after
	  leading assignment statements are removed
	- command_substitute now calls maybe_make_exported_env before making
	  the child process if there are no variable assignments preceding
	  the command currently being expanded, or if the command currently
	  being expanded consists only of variable assignments

execute_cmd.c
	- the `early fork' code in execute_simple_command now calls
	  maybe_make_export_env before forking because execute_disk_command
	  would do that in the vast majority of cases, and this will obviate
	  the need to do it for subsequent commands if the environment does
	  not change

				   4/27
				   ----
variables.h
	- more macros to manipulate the exportstr member of a SHELL_VAR
	- changed initialize_shell_variables to cache the value from the
	  environment as the initial exportstr for all imported variables
	- changed make_var_array to use exportstr if it exists, instead
	  of computing the value
	- changed make_var_array to cache exportstr for exported functions,
	  so they don't have to be deparsed every time the export env is
	  remade

				   4/28
				   ----
lib/readline/{histlib,rldefs}.h
	- changed STREQN macro to evaluate to 1 if the third argument is 0

lib/readline/search.c
	- changed rl_history_search_{for,back}ward so they leave point at
	  the end of the line when the string to search for is empty, like
	  previous-history and next-history
	- broke common code out of rl_history_search_{for,back}ward into
	  a new function, rl_history_search_reinit
	- rewrote rl_history_search_internal to be more like the
	  non-incremental search functions, use noninc_search_from_pos,
	  and leave the last history line found in the current line buffer
	  if the search fails
	- new function, make_history_line_current, takes care of making
	  the current line buffer a copy of the history entry passed as an
	  argument; used by rl_history_search_internal and noninc_dosearch

subst.c
	- make ${!prefix@} be the same as ${!prefix*} for (undocumented)
	  ksh93 compatibility

				   4/30
				   ----
lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- added note about including <readline/readline.h>, and that <stdio.h>
	  should be included before readline.h

	- updated version to 4.1

lib/readline/{bind,complete,display,isearch,nls,parens,readline,signals,tilde,
histexpand}.c
	- added prototypes with __P((...)) for forward static function
	  declarations

lib/readline/display.c
	- broke the code that initializes VISIBLE_LINE and INVISIBLE_LINE out
	  of rl_redisplay into a new function, init_line_structures, which
	  takes an argument giving the minimum number of characters that the
	  line must hold 
	- new function for use by applications that want to display the
	  initial prompt themselves rather than having the first call to
	  readline do it:  rl_on_new_line_with_prompt (modified from code in
	  the CLISP distribution)

lib/readline/readline.c
	- new external variable, rl_already_prompted, to let readline know
	  that the prompt string has already been displayed on the screen
	  before the first call to readline
	- test rl_already_prompted before displaying the prompt in
	  readline_internal_setup
	- if rl_already_prompted is non-zero, readline_internal_setup calls
	  rl_on_new_line_with_prompt instead of rl_on_new_line

lib/readline/readline.h
	- extern declaration for rl_on_new_line_with_prompt
	- extern declaration for rl_already_prompted

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- documented rl_on_new_line_with_prompt and rl_already_prompted

builtins/read.def
	- new -s option (silent mode).  Input from a terminal is not echoed

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented new `-s' option to read builtin

subst.c
	- make sure that verify_substring_values always passes malloc'd
	  memory to maybe_expand_string as the string to be expanded,
	  since it gets freed on errors

support/shobj-conf
	- don't need -R option for shared libraries on Solaris
	- new stanza for OSF/1 machines with gcc

lib/readline/readline.c
	- new variable, rl_gnu_readline_p, always 1.  Available to allow
	  readline users to test whether or not they're linking against
	  the true readline, rather than some bogus replacement (from CLISP)

lib/readline/readline.h
	- extern declaration for rl_gnu_readline_p

hashlib.h, hashcmd.h
	- added prototypes to extern function declarations

pcomplete.h
	- new file, declarations for the programmable completion stuff

subst.c
	- new function, #ifdef READLINE, skip_to_delim (s, i, delims).
	  Starting at s[i], return the index of the first character in s
	  that is contained in delims.  Understands shell quoting.
	- added two arguments to list_string_with_quotes: an index to
	  watch for, and a pointer to int to return the index into the
	  created word list of the word containing the sentinel.  Now
	  compiled in all the time.  The returned index starts at 1.

subst.h
	- extern declarations for char_is_quoted, unclosed_pair, and
	  skip_to_delim
	- changed extern declaration for list_string_with_quotes, moved
	  it out of the #ifdef ARRAY_VARS section

stringlib.c
	- new function, strcreplace(char *string, int c, char *text, int do_glob)
	  replaces all occurrences of C in STRING with TEXT.  Backslash may

	  string at $IFS first, then expand each individual word

				   5/27
				   ----
lib/readline/histfile.c
	- change things so that O_BINARY mode is used when reading and writing
	  the history file on cygwin32 as well as OS/2 (__EMX__)

parse.y
	- add calls to push_delimiter and pop_delimiter around the call
	  to parse_matched_pair when parsing $'...' and $"..." so the
	  history entry is added correctly

				   5/28
				   ----
doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}, lib/readline/doc/rluser.texinfo
	- documented new programmable completion facilities

doc/bashref.texi
	- documented new configure `--enable-progcomp' option

				    6/1
				    ---
variables.c
	- if make_local_variable is being asked to make a local shadow
	  variable of a read-only variable, print an error message and
	  return NULL
	- if make_local_variable returns NULL to make_local_array_variable,
	  just return it

builtins/declare.def
	- if we're making local variables, and make_local_array_variable or
	  make_local_variable returns NULL, just flag an error and go on

				    6/2
				    ---
Makefile.in
	- changed release status to `alpha1'

[bash-2.04-alpha1 frozen]

				   6/18
				   ----
bashline.c
	- fixed find_cmd_start so that it doesn't spin-loop on commands with
	  a command separator like `;' or `&'.  Problem was not incrementing
	  `os' past the delimiter found

				   6/21
				   ----
variables.c
	- cosmetic change: introduced two macros to encapsulate initialization
	  of dynamic variables

				   6/23
				   ----
pcomplib.c
	- new function: num_progcomps(void), returns the number of entries in
	  the programmable completions hash table

pcomplete.h
	- extern declaration for num_progcomps

bashline.c
	- make sure some programmable completions have been defined before
	  diving into the programmable completion code

shell.c
	- in open_shell_script, move the fd opened to the script to a high
	  one with move_to_high_fd in all cases -- the buffered input code
	  still has problems if fd == 0 and later on fd 0 is closed or
	  redirected (cf. input.c:check_bash_input())

builtins/printf.def
	- getlong() now calls strtol directly with a third argument of 0 so
	  it can handle 0x (hex) and 0 (octal) prefixes, which legal_number
	  does not -- this has implications for arguments to %d that begin
	  with `0'

lib/sh/getenv.c
	- make sure that the variable found in the temporary environment has
	  a non-null value before calling savestring() on it

subst.c
	- make sure split_at_delims returns 0 in *nwp and *cwp if handed a
	  null or empty string

pcomplete.c
	- make sure build_arg_list handles lwords == 0, as it will be if an
	  empty command line is handed to the programmable completion code
	  (like compgen -C xyz)

execute_cmd.c
	- make sure execute_shell_function passes a non-null bitmap of fds to
	  close to execute_function, allocating and deallocating it locally

sig.c
	- don't mess with SIGPROF in initialize_terminating_signals

jobs.c, nojobs.c
	- if the user has requested it with checkwinsize, check for a new
	  window size after a job exits due to a signal as well as being
	  stopped

lib/readline/kill.c
	- changed rl_kill_region to set the point to the beginning of the
	  region after the kill is performed

				   6/24
				   ----
configure.in
	- make sure ranges ([1-9]*) are protected with [...] for m4 quoting

variables.c
	- make sure that bind_variable_value honors `set -a' and that it
	  marks the environment for recreation if necessary

				   6/25
				   ----
lib/readline/complete.c
	- if we're completing at the end of the line, find_completion_word
	  shouldn't test whether the character is a special word break
	  char and (possibly) advance rl_point past the end of the buffer

parse.y
	- change mk_msgstr to write embedded newlines as `\n"<NL>"', as the
	  PO file format apparently requires

				   6/28
				   ----
lib/readline/display.c
	- code to manage the growth of the inv_lbreaks and vis_lbreaks arrays
	  beyond 256, since there are pathalogical command lines that can
	  have more than 256 line breaks for redisplay

				   6/30
				   ----
stringlib.c
	- include pathexp.h for extern declaration of quote_globbing_chars

variables.h
	- change CACHE_EXPORTSTR to savestring() the value and not set the
	  att_importstr flag

				    7/6
				    ---
support/bashbug.sh
	- bashbug now accepts --help and --version options

bashline.c
	- change bash_quote_filename to use single quotes if the user
	  does not specify an opening quote character and the filename being
	  completed contains newlines

				    7/8
				    ---
configure.in, aclocal.m4, config.h.in
	- BASH_TYPE_INT32_T --> BASH_TYPE_BITS32_T; int32_t --> bits32_t
	- BASH_TYPE_U_INT32_T --> BASH_TYPE_U_BITS32_T; u_int32_t --> u_bits32_t

lib/malloc/{malloc,gmalloc}.c, lib/sh/inet_aton.c
	- int32_t --> bits32_t; u_int32_t --> u_bits32_t

aclocal.m4
	- new tests: BASH_TYPE_BITS16_T, BASH_TYPE_U_BITS16_T

configure.in
	- add check for sizeof short, sizeof char
	- call BASH_TYPE_BITS16_T, BASH_TYPE_U_BITS16_T

config.h.in
	- new #defines for bits16_t, u_bits16_t

lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- use u_bits16_t for type of mi_magic2


				   7/16
				   ----
lib/readline/display.c
	- new private library function, _rl_strip_prompt, to remove instances
	  of RL_PROMPT_{START,END}_IGNORE from the passed prompt string

lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- extern declaration for _rl_strip_prompt

lib/readline/readline.c
	- call _rl_strip_prompt before outputting the prompt if we're not
	  doing any echoing of input chars (readline_echoing_p == 0)

Makefile.in
	- tentative change to rule for parser-built: use $< instead of
	  `y.tab.h' in recipe

				   7/19
				   ----
support/config.{guess,sub}
	- add code to handle all versions of Mac OS (e.g., Mac OS X)

				   7/26
				   ----
lib/readline/bind.c
	- on cygwin32, treat \r\n as a line terminator when reading the
	  inputrc file

				   7/29
				   ----
lib/sh/netopen.c
	- fixed problem in _getaddr with copying the address returned from
	  gethostbyname to the `struct in_addr *' argument -- hostnames
	  now work in /dev/(tcp|udp)/host/port

				    8/2
				    ---
configure.in
	- on Apple Rhapsody systems, set LOCAL_CFLAGS to -DRHAPSODY

variables.h
	- changes from Apple for building fat binaries on Rhapsody,
	  setting HOSTYPE, OSTYPE, VENDOR, and MACHTYPE

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- some work on the `dumb terminal' setup code in _rl_init_terminal_io
	  to make sure it's complete for use by the redisplay code and some
	  stuff in {readline,complete}.c

lib/readline/display.c
	- new function, _rl_current_display_line, returns the number of
	  lines down from the first `screen line' of the current readline
	  line the cursor is

lib/readline/readline.c
	- make rl_refresh_line call _rl_current_display_line

lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- extern declaration for _rl_current_display_line

				    8/3
				    ---
doc/bashref.texi
	- reorganized slightly:
		o a new shell builtins chapter
		o a new shell variables chapter
		o a new special builtins section
		o bourne shell features chapter removed
		o alias builtins moved to the bash builtins section
		o bourne shell differences moved to appendix
		o order of readline and history chapters swapped
		o indices are now unnumbered appendices
		o some text cleaned up and some explanatory text added

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- if a calling application is using a custom redisplay function,
	  don't call tgetent to get the terminal attributes, since those
	  are used only by the redisplay code.  Still get the window
	  size, though

lib/glob/fnmatch.c
	- range comparisons in bracket expressions no longer use strcoll(3),
	  since in some locales (de, for example), [A-Z] matches all
	  characters

parse.y, print_cmd.c
	- some changes to make sure the shell compiles when
	  DPAREN_ARITHMETIC is not defined but ARITH_FOR_COMMAND is

				    8/5
				    ---
redir.c
	- in the here document code in do_redirection_internal, check
	  that the file descriptor returned by here_document_to_fd is not
	  the same as a file descriptor specified as the redirector
	  before closing it

				    8/6
				    ---
parse.y
	- make sure the pipline rule for `timespec BANG pipeline' sets the
	  CMD_INVERT_RETURN flag for the pipeline command

builtins/wait.def
	- use setjmp with a special jump buffer to take longjmps in the
	  case that a SIGINT is received while waiting for jobs or processes
	  it makes wait return with a status > 128, as POSIX.2 specifies

{jobs,nojobs}.c
	- changed wait_sigint_handler to longjmp to wait_intr_buf if it's
	  executing the wait builtin and SIGINT is trapped.  It calls
	  trap_handler to make sure a pending trap for SIGINT is set also,
	  so the trap is taken when the wait builtin returns

				    8/9
				    ---
jobs.c
	- save and restore the value of errno in sigchld_handler

trap.c
	- save and restore the value of errno in trap_handler

				   8/10
				   ----
Makefile.in
	- changed release status to beta1

				   8/13
				   ----
include/posixtime.h
	- new file to encapsulate the <time.h> and <sys/time.h> mess

Makefile.in
	- add posixtime.h to list of include files in BASHINCFILES
	- update dependencies for general.o, execute_cmd.o

general.c, execute_cmd.c, builtins/times.def
	- include posixtime.h instead of <time.h>, <sys/time.h>

general.c
	- protect inclusion of <sys/times.h> with HAVE_SYS_TIMES_H check

builtins/Makefile.in
	- update dependencies for times.o

				   8/16
				   ----
lib/sh/timeval.c
	- moved functions dealing with struct timevals here from general.c
	  and execute_cmd.c

lib/sh/clock.c
	- moved functions dealing with clock_ts here from general.c
	  (print_time_in_hz renamed to print_clock_t)

externs.h
	- moved extern declarations for timeval_to_secs and print_timeval
	  here from general.h
	- moved extern declarations for clock_t_to_secs and print_clock_t
	  here from general.h

builtins/times.def
	- calls to print_time_in_hz changed to print_clock_t

Makefile.in
	- added references for lib/sh/timeval.c and lib/sh/clock.c

lib/sh/Makefile.in
	- clock.o and timeval.o are now included in libsh.a

				   8/23
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- make sure last_command_exit_value is updated before running a
	  DEBUG trap in the cm_simple case of execute_command_internal

lib/readline/display.c
	- new function, static void redraw_prompt (char *), used to
	  redraw the last line of a multiline prompt that possibly
	  contains terminal escape sequences
	- call redraw_prompt from _rl_redisplay_after_sigwinch

				   8/24
				   ----
lib/readline/bind.c
	- new struct with names of string-valued readline variables and
	  handler functions to call when the variable is set
	- changed rl_variable_bind to use functions to find boolean vars
	  and string vars in their respective lists
	- new function, bool_to_int, to translate a boolean value that may
	  appear as an argument to `set <boolean-var-name>' to 1 or 0
	- new function, hack_special_boolean_var, called if the element in
	  the boolean_vars struct has the V_SPECIAL flag set, to provide
	  any necessary other action when a boolean variable is set
	- new functions to be called when each string variable is set;
	  called by rl_variable_bind

execute_cmd.c
	- do_piping no longer sets pipes to O_TEXT mode if __CYGWIN32__
	  is defined

				   8/25
				   ----
subst.c
	- parameter_brace_patsub now mallocs a local copy of `patsub', because
	  if it starts with a `/' we increment it, and functions down the call
	  chain will free that on an error (and if we pass the incremented
	  value, will try to free unallocated memory)
	- pos_params now short-circuits and returns a null string immediately
	  if start == end, meaning we want 0 positional parameters

				   8/26
				   ----
subst.c
	- fixed pat_subst to correctly handle a null replacement string with
	  a null pattern string prefixed with `%' or `#'

				    9/3
				    ---
variables.c
	- don't import shell functions from the environment if the shell was
	  started with -n

				    9/8
				    ---
subst.c
	- if a command substitution is being performed inside a shell function,
	  catch `return' in command_substitute so that a return inside the
	  command substitution doesn't jump back to execute_function (or one
	  of its brethren) and go on with the command

parse.y
	- in history_delimiting_chars, if the first line is `for var' and
	  command_oriented_history is active, we don't want a semicolon if
	  the next token to be read is `in', but we do want one otherwise.
	  All we can do is check shell_input_line and see if the next chars
	  are `in' -- if so, we return " "

				   9/16
				   ----
builtins/hash.def
	- don't allow `hash -p /pathname/with/slashes name' if the shell
	  is restricted

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- updated description of restricted shell mode

lib/readline/display.c
	- fixed a bug in _rl_update_final which used the inv_lbreaks array
	  to index into visible_line

jobs.c
	- waitchld() need not go through the pain of setting up an environment
	  to execute traps on SIGCHLD if children_exited == 0
	- waitchld returns -1 if waitpid() returns -1 with errno == ECHILD,
	  indicating that there are no unwaited-for child processes, and it
	  has not yet reaped any dead children
	- wait_for, wait_for_single_pid return -1 if waitchld() returns -1
	- new function, mark_all_jobs_as_dead
	- wait_for_background_pids calls mark_all_jobs_as_dead if
	  wait_for_single_pid returns -1 with errno == ECHILD, since there are
	  no unwaited-for child processes

subst.c
	- tentative change: subshells started for command substitution no
	  longer unconditionally disable job control

				   9/17
				   ----
parse.y
	- new function: save_token_state().  Saves the value of last_read_token
	  and the two previous tokens in an allocated array and returns the
	  array
	- new function: restore_token_state(ts).  TS is an array returned by
	  save_token_state.  last_read_token and the two previous tokens are
	  set from the values in TS

trap.c
	- run_pending_traps calls save_token_state and restore_token_state
	  around the call to parse_and_execute, which will call the parser
	  and possibly leave it in a state where reserved words will not be
	  recognized (_run_trap_internal, too)

				   9/20
				   ----
support/bashbug.sh
	- if sendmail is used as $RMAIL, pass `-i -t' as arguments so changes
	  made by the user to the recipient headers in the message are
	  honored

				   9/21
				   ----
bashhist.c
	- if histverify has been set, make sure a `:p' modifier to a history
	  expansion prints the result

builtins/echo.def
	- new extern variable, xpg_echo, set to 1 if DEFAULT_ECHO_TO_USG is
	  defined and 0 otherwise
	- echo_builtin now sets the initial value of do_v9 from xpg_echo

builtins/shopt.def
	- new shopt option, `xpg_echo', turns backslash escape expansion by
	  `echo' on and off at runtime

builtins/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented new `xpg_echo' shell option

tests/{builtins.tests,builtins2.sub,shopt.tests}
	- changes for new `xpg_echo' shell option

configure.in
	- changes for FreeBSD-3.x ELF to add `-rdynamic' to LOCAL_LDFLAGS.
	  This allows dynamic loading of builtins

support/shobj-conf
	- changes to handle FreeBSD-3.x elf or a.out object file formats

				   9/23
				   ----
[bash-2.04-beta1 released]

				   9/24
				   ----
jobs.c
	- wait_for returns -1 only if the shell is currently executing the
	  `wait' builtin, since that's the only thing that cares

execute_cmd.c
	- moved cases of close_fd_bitmap to before calls to do_piping to
	  handle some pathological cases

				   9/29
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- save the command line in execute_simple_command before making the
	  export environment, since maybe_make_export_env clobbers
	  the_printed_command if there are exported functions

				   9/30
				   ----
configure.in,config.h.in
	- check explicitly for setvbuf; define HAVE_SETVBUF if found

configure.in
	- change opt_gnu_malloc to opt_bash_malloc, since the bash malloc
	  is not really the gnu malloc anymore
	- new argument, --with-bash-malloc, identical to --with-gnu-malloc
	- AC_DEFINE(USING_BASH_MALLOC) if opt_bash_malloc is enabled

config.h.in
	- new #define for USING_BASH_MALLOC

doc/bashref.texi
	- updated installation section to add --with-bash-malloc and
	  change description of --with-gnu-malloc

lib/sh/setlinebuf.c
	- change name of function to sh_setlinebuf, just returns 0 if
	  HAVE_SETVBUF and HAVE_SETLINEBUF are undefined
	- prefer setvbuf to setlinebuf if we have both
	- if we're using setvbuf, use a local buffer for stdin and stdout
	  local buffer is BUFSIZ unless we're using the bash malloc
	  (USING_BASH_MALLOC is defined), in which case it's 1008 (which
	  the bash malloc rounds up to 1024)

				   10/4
				   ----
input.c
	- if USING_BASH_MALLOC is defined, set the max buffer size to 8176,
	  which the bash malloc rounds up to 8192

				   10/5
				   ----
pcomplete.c
	- new function, pcomp_filename_completion_function, a wrapper for
	  filename_completion_function that dequotes the filename first

bashline.c
	- changed bash_directory_completion_matches to dequote the filename
	  before passing it (indirectly) to filename_completion_function

execute_cmd.c
	- change execute_command to defer calling unlink_fifo_list until any
	  shell function has finished executing (variable_context == 0)

configure.in
	- added AC_CYGWIN, AC_MINGW32, AC_EXEEXT

				   10/8
				   ----
subst.c
	- expand_word_internal(): changes some things to avoid small (2 or 3
	  byte) calls to xmalloc -- added a label and some gotos (BEWARE)
	- changed make_dev_fd_filename so it doesn't call sprintf anymore

				   10/27

execute_cmd.c
	- make execute_select_command handle the effects of the `continue'

parse.y
	- make sure parsing conditional commands isn't confused by unexpected
	  tokens (like `[[)]]')

builtins/common.c
	- fix get_job_spec to return NO_JOB for numeric job specs that are
	  beyond the size of the jobs table

builtins/type.def
	- change describe_command to report `not found' if a path search
	  returns the same string as the command name and the command name
	  does not match an executable file.  This has implications for
	  `type' and `command -[vV]'.
	- if a command is not found in $PATH, but an executable file with the
	  name supplied exists in the current directory, make the command
	  into a full pathname for the `command' builtin.  This has
	  implications for `type' and `command -[vV]'

subst.c
	- new function, expand_prompt_string, expands prompt string and
	  returns the string passed if an error occurs

subst.h
	- extern declaration for expand_prompt_string

parse.y
	- decode_prompt_string calls expand_prompt_string instead of
	  expand_string_unsplit

				   11/22
				   -----
builtins/echo.def
	- return EXECUTION_FAILURE if ferror(stdout) is true

				   11/23
				   -----
locale.c
	- if LC_ALL is unset, call setlocale(LC_ALL, lc_all), because lc_all
	  holds the default locale

				   11/29
				   -----
lib/readline/shell.c
	- define NULL as 0 if it's not defined
	- change single_quote to allocate 4 characters in new string for
	  each character in the old one (like builtins/common.c:single_quote)

locale.c
	- when a locale variable (LC_*) is unset, pass "" to setlocale()
	  to get the default locale set, since value is NULL

lib/sh/makepath.c
	- new function, sh_makepath(char *path, char *dir, int flags)

Makefile.in
	- changed version to beta3

builtins/type.def
	- changed describe_command to use sh_makepath()

builtins/cd.def
	- removed private declaration of mkpath(), changed to use sh_makepath

general.c
	- changed make_absolute to use sh_makepath

findcmd.c
	- removed private definition of make_full_pathname, changed to use
	  sh_makepath

doc/{bashref.texi,bash.1}
	- added text to description of `getopts' to make it clear that getopts
	  may be used to parse option characters other than letters, and
	  that `:' and `?' may not be used as option characters

eval.c
	- when processing a jump_to_top_level(EXITPROG), make sure the shell
	  doesn't think it's still in a function by setting variable_context
	  to 0

doc/rbash.1
	- a skeletal man page for rbash, adapted from debian

support/bashbug.sh
	- try to find a default editor if EDITOR is unset, rather than blindly
	  using `emacs'

				   11/30

support/config.{guess,sub}
	- many changes from the latest `automake' distribution, from the
	  Debian folks

				   12/2

				   ----
subst.c
	- in process_substitute, make sure the child resets the O_NONBLOCK
	  flag on the file descriptor opened for read to a named pipe

jobs.c
	- new function, raw_job_exit_status, returns exit status of last job
	  in pipeline
	- change job_exit_status to call raw_job_exit_status and pass the
	  result to process_exit_status
	- in notify_of_job_status, get termination status from call to
	  raw_job_exit_status, rather than the first job in the pipeline
	  (fixes debian bug #15165)

bashhist.c
	- changed bash_history to not add shell comment lines to the history
	  file (fixes debian bug #21901).  Uses new function shell_comment(L)
	  which returns 1 if L is a shell comment line.  Doesn't handle
	  comments embedded in lines yet

redir.c
	- when running in POSIX.2 mode, bash no longer performs word splitting
	  on the expanded value of the word supplied as the filename argument
	  to a redirection operator (fixes debian bug #30460)

doc/bashref.texi
	- added new redirection stuff to POSIX Mode section (from previous fix)

				   12/6
				   ----
hashlib.h
	- removed extra semicolon at end of HASH_ENTRIES define

redir.c
	- replaced toggling of disallow_filename_globbing flag with setting

	  POSIX mode and not interactive when expanding the filename argument
	  to a redirection

				   12/7

builtins/common.c
	- new function, backslash_quote_for_double_quotes(char *), quotes

	  #ifdef PROMPT_STRING_DECODE; called by decode_prompt_string

builtins/common.h
	- extern declaration for backslash_quote_for_double_quotes

parse.y
	- before expanding the \u prompt string escape sequence, make sure
	  current_user.user_name is non-null and call get_current_user_info
	  if it is

				   12/10
				   -----
support/mkversion.sh
	- changes to avoid relying on floating point output format, which
	  can be locale-specific

				   12/14
				   -----
print_cmd.c
	- changes to named_function_string (for normal function printing)
	  and print_function_def (for printing function definitions embedded
	  in other commands) to print redirections that should be attached
	  to the function as a whole after the closing brace

tests/func1.sub
	- tests for printing functions with attached redirections, called by
	  func.tests

				   12/16
				   -----
lib/readline/complete.c
	- if we're completing files in the root directory and executing the
	  visible-stats code, don't pass an empty pathname to
	  rl_directory_completion_hook, because, for bash, that will be
	  expanded to the current directory.  Just pass `/' instead.

lib/tilde/tilde.c
	- fix to tilde_expand_word for Cygwin to avoid creating pathnames
	  beginning with `//' if $HOME == `/'

variables.c
	- don't bother with the exportstr validation on cygwin systems,
	  or even using exportstr at all, since that system has weird
	  environment variables

				   12/17
				   -----
configure.in
	- new option, --enable-xpg-echo-default, new name for
	  --enable-usg-echo-default (which is still present for backwards
	  compatibility)

configure.in, config.h.in, builtins/echo.def
	- DEFAULT_ECHO_TO_USG -> DEFAULT_ECHO_TO_XPG

				   12/29
				   -----
aclocal.m4
	- changed a couple of tests to avoid creating files with known
	  names in /tmp

support/rlvers.sh
	- changed to create files in /tmp/rlvers

support/mksignames.c
	- now understands the POSIX.1b real-time signal names on systems
	  that support them

				   12/30
				   -----
[bash-2.04-beta3 released]

				   12/31
				   -----
redir.c
	- try some more things to avoid race file replacements in
	  here_document_to_fd

parse.y
	- two new functions:
		get_current_prompt_level: returns 2 if current prompt is $PS2,
					  1 otherwise
		set_current_prompt_level: sets current prompt to $PS2 if arg
					  is 2, $PS1 otherwise

copy_cmd.c
	- make sure to copy the `line' member in copy_arith_for_command

pcomplete.c
	- free up `lwords' and `line' after evaluating any command or shell
	  function in gen_compspec_completions
	- after filtering any matches specified by cs->filterpat in
	  gen_compspec_completions, free ret->list (the members have
	  already been copied or freed by filter_stringlist)

bashline.c
	- free what find_cmd_name returns after calling the programmable
	  completion code

				 1/4/2000
				 --------
subst.c 
	- make call_expand_word_internal set w->word to NULL if either
	  expand_word_error or expand_word_fatal is returned 

				    1/7
				    ---
parse.y
	- two new functions: set_current_prompt_level(int) and
	  get_current_prompt_level() to set and get the `level' of
	  current_prompt_string (1 if $PS1, 2 if $PS2)

externs.h
	- extern declarations for {get,set}_current_prompt_level

builtins/evalstring.c
	- add an unwind_protect to save and restore the current prompt
	  string pointers using {get,set}_current_prompt_level

				    1/9
				    ---
Makefile.in
	- changed release status to `beta4'

				   1/18

[bash-2.04-beta4 released]

				   1/19
				   ----
configure.in
	- moved checks for non-unix variants to beginning of tests

Makefile.in, {builtins,support}/Makefile.in
	- added some $(EXEEXT) suffixes to generated programs for non-Unix
	  systems

				   1/20
				   ----
parse.y
	- make get_current_prompt_level return 1 if current_prompt_string is
	  NULL (as it would be while sourcing startup files)

support/rlvers.sh
	- rmdir $TDIR in the exit trap
	- move the exit trap after we successfully create $TDIR

				   1/21
				   ----
subst.c
	- several changes to split_at_delims to make non-whitespace
	  delimiters create separate fields containing those delimiters,
	  like the shell parser does with meta characters.  This allows
	  redirection operators, for example, to be treated as separate
	  words by the programmable completion code

examples/complete/complete-examples
	- added new function: _redir_op, which return true if the word
	  passed as an argument contains a redirection operator (just
	  bare-bones for now)
	- changed set completion function to use _redir_op as an example

parse.y
	- make parse_string_to_word_list save and restore the value of
	  shell_input_line_terminator, since an assignment like
	  COMPREPLY=() inside a shell function called by the programmable
	  completion code can change shell_input_line_terminator out from
	  underneath shell_getc().  shell_getc will set the input line
	  terminator to EOF when it gets EOF from the getter function, and
	  the string getter function returns EOF at EOS.  parse_and_execute
	  tests for EOS directly and never gets EOF from shell_getc, so it
	  does not have this problem.

				   1/24
				   ----
lib/readline/funmap.c
	- #define QSFUNC like in complete.c
	- cast _rl_qsort_string_compare to a QSFUNC * in the call to qsort

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- correct a typo in usage of the __EMX__ preprocessor define
	- fix a reversed usage of `#if defined (__DJGPP__)' in 
	  _rl_control_keypad
	- remove extern declarations for _rl_in_stream and _rl_out_stream

lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- add extern declaration for _rl_in_stream, since there's already
	  one for _rl_out_stream

builtins/ulimit.def
	- if bash is using ulimit(2), make sure that getfilesize() returns
	  the value multiplied by 512 to convert it from a number of blocks
	  to a number of bytes

				   1/25
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- make sure execute_command_internal sets last_command_exit_value
	  correctly when inverting the return value of a (...) subshell
	  command

tests/{run-invert,invert.{tests,right}}
	- new tests for return value inversion

configure.in
	- compile without bash malloc on m68k-motorola-sysv due to a file
	  descriptor leak in closedir(3) -- the motorola implementation
	  requires that freed memory be readable so it can free the dirent
	  and then look back at it to find the file descriptor

expr.c
	- fix negative exponents in v**e to return an eval error

				    2/1
				    ---
Makefile.in
	- changed status to beta5

jobs.c
	- fixed a problem with checking the wrong process when checking to
	  see whether or not we need to reset the tty state.  The old code
	  checked the first process in a pipeline; the new code checks all
	  processes in the pipeline to see whether any of them exited due
	  to a signal or was stopped.  If none were signalled or stopped,
	  the code uses the exit status of the last process in the job's
	  pipeline

				    2/4

[bash-2.04-beta5 released]

eval.c
	- call set_current_prompt_level instead of setting prompt_string_pointer
	  directly

				   2/10
				   ----
[bash-2.04-beta5 re-released to net]

				   2/11
				   ----
sig.c
	- make sure SIGCHLD is defined in initialize_shell_signals before
	  trying to use it in sigdelset() (DJGPP fix)

				   2/14
				   ----
lib/sh/shtty.c
	- include <unistd.h> before <shtty.h>
	- separate tests for ONLCR, ONOCR, ONLRET to cope with systems like
	  DJGPP that don't implement the full POSIX termios option set

builtins/psize.sh
	- set TMPDIR only if it's not already set

lib/glob/glob.c
	- if a system doesn't define _POSIX_SOURCE but has a `struct dirent'
	  without a d_ino member, define REAL_DIR_ENTRY to 1 so all entries
	  are read

configure.in
	- check for <arpa/inet.h> header file

config.h.in
	- add HAVE_ARPA_INET_H define

lib/sh/inet_aton.c
	- don't compile unless HAVE_NETWORK, HAVE_NETINET_IN_H, and
	  HAVE_ARPA_INET_H are all defined in config.h or config-bot.h

				   2/16
				   ----
subst.c
	- if we have a construct like "${@:-}", we need to note that we're
	  not using whatever is in $@ (we're using the rhs), so the special
	  double-quoting $@ rules do not apply

				   2/21
				   ----
lib/readline/signals.c
	- declare SigHandler before using it on non-POSIX systems

lib/sh/{zread,zwrite}.c
	- include <sys/types.h> unconditionally

configure.in
	- m68k-motorola-sysv should be m68k-sysv in the section that sets
	  opt_bash_malloc to no for certain systems

builtins/complete.def
	- fixed a typo (stoppped) when printing out completion actions

				   2/22
				   ----
lib/sh/netopen.c
	- include <arpa/inet.h> if it's present

aclocal.m4
	- new macro, BASH_FUNC_INET_ATON, checks for inet_aton(3) including
	  <netinet/in.h> and <arpa/inet.h>, which some systems require to
	  resolve the function

configure.in
	- if autoconf can't fund inet_aton on its own, try BASH_FUNC_INET_ATON

pcomplete.c
	- fixed a memory leak in gen_wordlist_completions
	- changed gen_wordlist_completions to do prefix-matching against the
	  word being completed

doc/bash.1, lib/readline/doc/rluser.texinfo
	- documented the change in behavior of the -W option to complete and
	  compgen

builtins/umask.def
	- if parse_symbolic_mode() returns -1, symbolic_umask needs to return
	  -1 as well, otherwise the umask will be changed inappropriately

input.c
	- always compile in getc_with_restart and ungetc_with_restart

parse.y
	- yy_stream_get and yy_stream_unget now call getc_with_restart and
	  ungetc_with_restart, respectively, to avoid problems with some
	  systems not restarting the read(2) when signals that bash handles
	  are received during the read (since bash installs its signal
	  handlers without the SA_RESTART flag)

lib/readline/complete.c
	- don't default rl_completion_case_fold to 1 if __DJGPP__ is defined

				   2/25
				   ----
subst.c
	- renamed `varlist' to `subst_assign_varlist' and made it global

jobs.c
	- when running a SIGCHLD trap, need to unwind-protect
	  subst_assign_varlist and set it to NULL before running the trap
	  command (fix from ericw@bestnet.org and doogie@debian.org)

				   2/28
				   ----
lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- document rl_funmap_names()

				   2/29
				   ----
subst.c
	- change split_at_delims to set the current word more appropriately
	  when the cursor is between two words.  Should probably change this
	  again to set the current word like this only when the cursor is at
	  whitespace or another delim just before the word start

				    3/1
				    ---
lib/sh/shtty.c
	- more checks for flag bits being defined before using them

				    3/7
				    ---
variables.h
	- fix typo in COPY_EXPORTSTR definition 

				   3/14
				   ----
subst.c
	- changed split_at_delims so that if the cursor is at whitespace
	  between words, and we're interested in the current word (cwp != NULL),
	  make a new empty word and set the cwp to that word

locale.c
	- support for setting LC_NUMERIC locale category based on value of
	  LC_NUMERIC shell variable

variables.c
	- LC_NUMERIC is now treated specially

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- LC_NUMERIC updates

				   3/15

				   3/27
				   ----
lib/readline/rltty.c
	- fixed a missing-semicolon syntax error in the old 4.3 BSD tty code

support/mksignames.c
	- if SIGRTMAX is >= 2*NSIG, just #undef SIGRTMIN and SIGRTMAX.  This
	  is an issue on AIX 4.3 (only, so far) -- checked by configure, which
	  #defines UNUSABLE_RT_SIGNALS if this is the case

aclocal.m4
	- new macro, BASH_CHECK_RTSIGS, checks whether or not real-time
	  signals are defined with large values and defines UNUSABLE_RT_SIGNALS
	  if they are

config.h.in
	- place marker for UNDEF_RT_SIGNALS (initially undefined)

configure.in
	- call BASH_CHECK_RTSIGS in the `bash miscellaneous' section

				   3/29
				   ----

subst.c
	- fixed a problem in match_pattern_char, where `string' was checked
	  for a paren following a [?+!@], rather than `pat'
	- the code that checks whether or not to exit after a failed
	  ${word?msg} substitution needs to check interactive_shell rather
	  than interactive to avoid exiting if such a construct appears in
	  a sourced file

				   3/31
				   ----

bashline.c
	- add `{' to the list of characters that need to be quoted by the
	  completion code when appearing in a filename

				    4/1
				    ---
lib/glob/fnmatch.c
	- fixed an error in brackmatch() while skipping the rest of a bracket
	  expression after a character matched.  When `c' was a backslash and
	  *p was a backslash, as in a pattern like [/\\], the old code didn't
	  take both backslashes into account and ended up skipping the `]'
	  after erroneously concluding that it was quoted.  Report and fix
	  from akim@epita.fr

				    4/3
				    ---
lib/readline/rltty.c
	- slight change to the BSD tty interface code, so that if the first
	  ioctl fails, get_tty_settings returns -1 immediately
	- better checking of ioctl return values in BSD tty version of
	  get_tty_settings

				    4/5
				    ---
doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented use of LINES and COLUMNS variables

				   4/12
				   ----
lib/readline/rltty.c
	- change the SETATTR define for the termio tty driver to use
	  TCSETAW (the analog of the termios TCSADRAIN)

lib/glob/fnmatch.c
	- fix for posix-style bracket expressions ([:xxx:], [=x=]) broken
	  by fix of 4/1 for quotes in bracket expressions

				   4/26
				   ----
subst.c
	- fix to list_string and get_word_from_string to make a non-whitespace
	  IFS character preceded by IFS whitespace part of the current field
	  delimiter, not a separate delimiter that would result in a separate
	  null field when splitting.  cf POSIX.2, 3.6.5, (3)(b).  Bug reported
	  by amc@cs.berkeley.edu
	- changed the behavior of the (currently undocumented) ${!prefix@}
	  expansion to be analogous to the expansion of $@ in other contexts
	  when double-quoted.  ksh93 seems to do this.  Bug reported by
	  Ken Pizzini <ken@halcyon.com>
	- changed read_comsub to ignore NUL bytes in the command substitution
	  output, printing a warning message for now

parse.y
	- changed shell_getc to ignore NUL bytes in the input, printing a
	  warning message for now
	- changed read_a_line to print a warning when a NUL byte is encountered,
	  like shell_getc does

				   5/18
				   ----
subst.c
	- make sure split_at_delims uses d2 only if it's non-null
	- make split_at_delims skip leading newlines in the string to split,
	  if newline is a delimiter

jobs.c
	- prevent hanging processes by marking a child process as not running
	  (even if the shell thinks it is) when waitpid() returns -1/ECHILD --
	  this indicates that waitpid never returned a reasonable status
	  for that child though, which may be a symptom of another problem

builtins/cd.def
	- make `pwd' print an error message if the write fails when displaying
	  the current directory

lib/readline/histexpand.c
	- return NULL from history_find_word if history_tokenize_internal
	  returns (char **)NULL rather than attempting to dereference a
	  possibly-NULL pointer
	- change history_tokenize_internal to set *indp to -1 before any
	  processing if indp is non-null

				   5/19
				   ----
builtins/trap.def
	- when in POSIX.2 mode and printing trap dispositions, print the
	  signal name without the leading `SIG', as POSIX.2 requires

				   5/23
				   ----
lib/readline/readline.c
	- readline_initialize_everything now assigns $TERM to rl_terminal_name
	  if the application has left it unset, and calls _rl_init_terminal_io
	  with the resultant value

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- updated the description of rl_terminal_name to note initialization

parse.y
	- change parse_string_to_word_list to save and restore the value of
	  current_command_line_count before calling back into the parser --
	  it will screw up history if the string extends over one line.  Bug
	  reported by Jan.Djarv@mbox200.swipnet.se

				    6/7
				    ---
unwind_prot.h
	- change unwind_protect_string to pass the address of the variable to
	  unwind_protect_var on machines where ints and char *s are not the
	  same size

unwind_prot.c
	- make sure we save the value of a variable in unwind_protect_var on
	  machines where sizeof(char *) != sizeof(int), not the contents the
	  value points to.  Fix from Andreas Schwab <schwab@suse.de>

				    6/8

configure.in
	- auto-configure MacOS X without bash malloc (like Rhapsody)

				   6/12

configure.in
	- replace `cygwin32' with `cygwin'

builtins/evalfile.c
	- in _evalfile, change all instances of \r to \n in the file to be
          sourced and evaluated if __CYGWIN__ is defined

input.c
	- change \r to \n in the buffer argument to make_buffered_stream and
          after calling zread() from b_fill_buffer if __CYGWIN__ is defined

				   6/29
				   ----
lib/sh/Makefile.in
	- add rest of dependency rules for makepath.o

				    7/3

jobs.c
	- changed `int' to `WAIT' in a couple of places for non-POSIX
	  environments

				    7/5
				    ---
locale.c
	- try to avoid an unnecessary memory allocation in localetrans() in
	  the case that a translation for the string exists

lib/readline/doc/rluserman.texinfo
	- change the `direntry' information to make it use rluserman instead
	  of readline

				    7/6
				    ---
execute_cmd.c
	- changes to execute_in_subshell so it honors a `!' prefixing a command
	  inside a user subshell (...)

support/config.{guess,sub}
	- add cases for Apple Darwin (Mac OS X)

configure.in
	- Apple Darwin (MacOS X) uses its own malloc

lib/readline/readline.h
	- removed bogus extern declaration of savestring

				    7/7
				    ---
builtins/common.c
	- in get_working_directory, don't count on getcwd returning anything
	  useful in the buffer passed as the first argument on failure; just
	  use bash_getcwd_errstr in the error message

examples/loadables/cut.c
	- loadable version of cut(1), from the FreeBSD source tree

				   7/18
				   ----
lib/readline/vi_mode.c
	- changed two instances of (*rl_getc_function) (rl_instream) to calls
	  to rl_read_key(), which works better when using the readline
	  callback interface

builtins/evalfile.c
	- added FEVAL_CHECKBINARY flag for _evalfile; controls whether a check
	  for a binary file is performed
	- FEVAL_CHECKBINARY is not set by source_file or maybe_execute_file,
	  which means that the startup file execution and the `.' builtin will
	  not check for binary files
	- FEVAL_CHECKBINARY is not set by fc_execute_file, so that files
	  composed of history commands run by the `fc' builtin will not check
	  for binary files

				   7/21
				   ----
shell.c
	- added `--init-file' as a synonym for `--rcfile'

				   7/26
				   ----
support/shobj-conf
	- added commented-out stanzas for hpux 10 and hpux 11 when the HP
	  unbundled ANSI C compiler is being used

				   7/27
				   ----
shell.c
	- don't call end_job_control() from exit_shell if subshell_environment
	  is non-zero, even if the shell is interactive

				    8/1
				    ---
bashhist.c
	- change maybe_add_history to remember if we saved the first line of
	  a command and don't save the second and subsequent lines of a
	  multi-line command if we didn't save the first line

configure.in, config.h.in
	- add autoconf check for getservbyname()

lib/sh/netopen.c
	- add support for named services in /dev/(tcp|udp)/host/service
	  translation
	- make sure _netopen sets errno to something other than 0 if something
	  goes wrong, so the redirection functions behave

				    8/3
				    ---
parse.y
	- changes to shell_getc so that history saving of blank lines in
	  multi-line commands does a better job of syntactic correctness

bashline.c
	- bind ^O to operate-and-get-next in emacs_standard_keymap explicitly,
	  rather than letting rl_add_defun do it in whatever keymap is current

				    8/4
				    ---
builtins/ulimit.def
	- removed some of the special handling of RLIM_INFINITY -- the old
	  code would let people use RLIM_INFINITY as a shorthand for setting
	  the soft limit to the hard limit.  Now, the code just passes
	  RLIM_INFINITY through if the hard limit is being set, so any kernel
	  errors will get through

				   8/10
				   ----
parse.y
	- change the grammar rule for group_command so that it's composed of
	  a compound_list instead of a list, which requires a terminator
	  This means that you can now do (legal) things like

		{ { echo a b c ; } }

	  since the second close brace will be recognized as such because a
	  reserved word is legal in that context

				   8/23
				   ----
subst.c
	- fix parameter_brace_substring to free all memory allocated by
	  get_var_and_type in the VT_ARRAYMEMBER case (returned parameter
	  `val')

				   8/30
				   ----
variables.c
	- now that we have dynamic array variables, remove the check for
	  array_p in bind_variable and let array variables with assignment
	  functions call the assignment function

subst.c
	- change cond_expand_word to perform tilde expansion (like it should
	  have done all along)

lib/readline/complete.c
	- don't allow backslash to quote anything inside a single-quoted
	  string in find_completion_word

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- note that `set -a' will cause functions to be exported

lib/readline/parens.c
	- changed the blink timeout so it's settable by the application.  A
	  new function, int rl_set_paren_blink_timeout (int u), (still
	  undocumented) will set the timeout to U usec

variables.c
	- at startup of an interactive login shell, if the current directory
	  is $HOME, and $HOME and $PWD are not the same, set the current
	  directory (and $PWD) to $HOME
	- break code that initializes $PWD and $OLDPWD into set_pwd function

variables.h
	- new extern declaration for set_pwd()

				    9/6
				    ---
lib/readline/{readline,callback}.c
	- allocate memory for rl_prompt instead of simply using what's passed
	  as the `prompt' argument to readline() or
	  rl_callback_handler_install().  This will allow constant strings to
	  be passed to readline(), since the prompt processing code wants to
	  write to rl_prompt

lib/sh/pathcanon.c
	- new file, does pathname canonicalization

externs.h
	- extern declarations for stuff in lib/sh/pathcanon.c

general.c
	- canonicalize_pathname now simply calls sh_canonpath()

				    9/7
				    ---
pcomplete.h
	- new member in a `struct compspec': options
	- define some flag values for options field

pcomplib.c
	- make sure options field is allocated and copied by compspec utility
	  functions

builtins/complete.def
	- add struct for completion options.  These control the `meta-behavior'
	  of the compspec.  Initially, there are three:

		default - perform bash default completion if programmable
			  completion produces no matches
		dirnames - perform directory name completion if programmable
			   completion produces no matches
		filenames - tell readline that the compspec produces filenames,
			    so it can do things like append slashes to
			    directory names and suppress trailing spaces

	- add `-o option' to complete and compgen, setting new options field
	  in a compspec
	- add code to display any -o options when a compspect is printed
	  with the `-p' option to complete

pcomplete.c
	- programmable_completions now passes back to the caller in the last
	  argument any options associated with the active compspec (from the
	  options field)
	- change gen_compspec_completions to re-call gen_action_completions
	  with a CA_DIRECTORY action if the rest of the compspec actions
	  generate no matches and the COPT_DIRNAMES option is present

bashline.c
	- if a programmable completion was specified to return filenames with
	  the `-o filenames' option, set rl_filename_completion_desired to 1
	  so readline does its special filename-specific things
	- if a compspec was defined to fall back to the readline default with
	  the `-o default' option, suppress setting the
	  rl_attempted_completion_over variable in attempt_shell_completion
	  so readline will go on and do filename completion

include/ansi_stdlib.h
	- add extern declarations for atof and strtod

builtins/printf.def
	- change getdouble() to use strtod (since we provide a version in
	  libsh if the C library doesn't have one), and change the calling
	  convention to match the other getXXX functions (take value pointer
	  as argument, return success or failure).  This makes printf handle
	  invalid floating point numbers better

doc/bash.1, lib/readline/doc/rluser.texinfo
	- documented new `-o' option to complete and compgen; described the
	  arguments and their effects

lib/readline/{macro,util}.c
	- renamed _rl_executing_macro to rl_executing_macro; made it public

lib/readline/readline.h
	- new extern declaration for rl_executing_macro

lib/readline/rltech.texinfo
	- documented rl_executing_macro

				    8/8
				    ---
lib/readline/readline.c
	- new state variable, rl_readline_state

lib/readline/readline.h
	- extern declaration for rl_readline_state
	- define some flag bits for rl_readline_state and macros to test and
	  set them

lib/readline/{readline,complete,isearch,macro,rltty,search,signals,undo,vi_mode}.c
	- added calls to the macros that set and unset various readline states

lib/readline/readline.c
	- new private function, _rl_free_saved_history_line, to free up the
	  history entry saved in saved_line_for_history

lib/readline/search.c
	- free any saved history entry in rl_history_search_reinit(), because
	  rl_get_previous_history makes a call to maybe_save_line without
	  freeing up the saved line when it returns (so rl_get_next_history
	  can use it)
	- fix up noninc_search_from_pos to deal with invalid history indices
	  better

				   9/12
				   ----
support/shobj-conf
	- HPUX 11.0 needs the `-fpic' flag passed to the linker as well as
	  the compiler

execute_cmd.c
	- on MS-DOS systems, let the #! checking stuff in execute_shell_script
	  treat \r as EOL (identical to \n)

input.c
	- on DJGPP systems, allow buffered_getchar to ignore \r.  Change
	  suggested by snowball3@bigfoot.com

				   9/13
				   ----
lib/sh/tmpfile.c
	- new file, with functions for creating and (hopefully safely) opening
	  temporary files for the shell

externs.h
	- extern declarations for functions in tmpfile.c

variables.c
	- new function, get_random_number, returns random values from the
	  shell's (lame) RNG to the rest of the shell

variables.h
	- new extern declaration for get_random_number()

subst.c
	- changed make_named_pipe to call sh_mktmpname instead of mktemp

redir.c
	- changed here_document_to_fd to call sh_mktmpfd instead of using
	  inline code

builtins/fc.def
	- changed fc_builtin to call sh_mktmpfp instead of using inline code

builtins/common.h
	- new extern declaration for fc_execute_file()

bashline.c
	- if RL_ISSTATE(RL_STATE_INITIALIZED) is 0 in initialize_readline,
	  call rl_initialize to bind the defaults before setting up our
	  custom shell functions and key bindings

lib/readline/doc/{rluser,hsuser}.texinfo
	- some markup changes proposed by dima@chg.ru

lib/readline/rlstdc.h, lib/tilde/tilde.h
	- to get ready for some `const' changes to the source, define const
	  as either `__const' (gcc -traditional) or nothing if __STDC__ and
	  __cplusplus are not defined

lib/readline/readline.c
	- upped the default readline version to `4.2-alpha'

lib/readline/readline.[ch]
	- readline now takes a `const char *' as an argument

lib/readline/history.h
	- read_history(), read_history_range(), write_history(),
	  append_history(), history_truncate_file() now take `const char *'
	  filename arguments

lib/readline/histfile.c
	- history_filename(), read_history(), read_history_range(),
	  write_history(), append_history(), history_truncate_file(),
	  history_do_write() now take `const char *' filename arguments

lib/readline/readline.h
	- rl_read_init_file() now takes a `const char *' filename argument

lib/readline/bind.c
	- current_readline_init_file is now a `const char *'
	- _rl_read_init_file(), rl_read_init_file() now take `const char *'
	  filename arguments

lib/tilde/tilde.c
	- tilde_expand(), tilde_expand_word() now take a `const char *'
	  as their first argument

lib/readline/chardefs.h
	- fixed CTRL_CHAR macro to be right on systems where chars are unsigned
	  by default

				   9/14
				   ----
lib/readline/doc/{rl,hs}tech.texinfo
	- documented new `const char *' function arguments where appropriate

lib/readline/vi_mode.c
	- clamp the numeric argument in vi mode at 999999, just like in emacs
	  mode

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- documented rl_readline_state and its possible bit values

builtins/source.def
	- in maybe_pop_dollar_vars, don't overwrite a shell function's
	  argument list even if the sourced script changes the positional
	  parameters

lib/readline/{util.c,rlprivate.h}
	- made _rl_strindex() and _rl_savestring() take `const char *'
	  arguments

				   9/15
				   ----
subst.c
	- renamed `doing_completion' to `no_longjmp_on_fatal_error', a more
	  accurate description of its current behavior

pcomplete.[ch], externs.h, lib/sh/stringlist.c
	- moved the stringlist code from pcomplete.c to lib/sh/stringlist.c
	- moved the type declaration and extern function declarations from
	  pcomplete.h to externs.h

stringlib.c, externs.h, lib/sh/stringvec.c
	- moved the char array code from stringlib.c to lib/sh/stringvec.c

				   9/18
				   ----
subst.c
	- new static variable, expand_no_split_dollar_star, to ensure that
	  $* isn't `split and rejoined' when expanded via a call to
	  expand_string_unsplit or expand_word_no_split

				   9/19
				   ----
subst.[ch], execute_cmd.c
	- renamed expand_word_no_split to expand_word_unsplit

copy_cmd.c
	- in copy_word, just assign w->flags to new_word->flags rather than
	  bcopying the entire structure

configure.in, config.h.in
	- add autoconf check for pathconf(3)

lib/sh/tmpfile.c
	- test for systems with short filenames using pathconf and
	  _PC_NAME_MAX, so generated temp file names don't exceed that length
	  (only do this if the file name length is less than 32, since the
	  current code doesn't generate filenames longer than about 17 chars)

				   9/20
				   ----
command.h
	- added `W_NOSPLIT2' word flag to prepare for supporting weird $@
	  expansion on the rhs of assignment statements (inspecting the ksh93
	  behavior, it seems like nothing except $@ is split, and $@ is split
	  on $IFS and rejoined as a single string)

				   9/21
				   ----
subst.c
	- since verify_substring_values looks for arithmetic expressions
	  bounded by `:', do some ad-hoc parsing of the substring passed as
	  the argument to avoid cutting the expression off at the wrong `:'
	  (since the inclusion of conditional expressions, expressions may
	  contain a `:').  Do some paren balancing, too.

				   9/22
				   ----
command.h
	- new #define, CLOBBERING_REDIRECT, evaluates to true for any redirect
	  that will clobber a file and should be subject to `noclobber'

redir.c
	- changed redir_open to use CLOBBERING_REDIRECT instead of
	  OUTPUT_REDIRECT.  This means that <> no longer tests the value of
	  noclobber, as POSIX.2 specifies

parse.y
	- made a change to cond_term so that expressions like [[ (x) ]] are
	  parsed correctly

				   9/25
				   ----
parse.y
	- small change to grammar for arith_for_command and special_case_tokens
	  to allow `do...done' or {...} after ((...)) without an intervening
	  list_terminator (for ksh93 compatibility)

builtins/printf.def
	- `printf' now treats \E and \e the same when performing backslash
	  escape expansion for the %b format character for compatibility with
	  $'...' quoting (for ksh93 compatibility)

				   9/26
				   ----
builtins/source.def
	- new variable, source_searches_cwd, initially 1.  If non-zero, `.'
	  searches $PWD for the filename argument if it's not found in $PATH

general.c
	- changed posix_initialize to turn off source_searches_cwd if posix
	  mode is being enabled; turn it on if posix mode is being disabled
	- changed things so interactive_comments is not turned off if posix
	  mode is disabled, since that's rarely what is desired

variables.c
	- changed uidset() to set UID and EUID only if they are not already
	  set when the shell starts up
	- changed things to HOSTNAME is set only if it's not set when the
	  shell starts up

execute_cmd.c
	- changed execute_builtin_or_function so that if a command like
	  `command exec 4<file' is executed, the effect is as if the `command'
	  had been omitted, as POSIX.2 requires

subst.c
	- changed array_length_reference to support ${foo[X]} when foo is not
	  an array variable and X is 0, @, or * (everything else returns 0)
	  for ksh compatibility
	- changed array_value_internal to support ${foo[@]} and ${foo[*]}
	  when foo is not an array variable (as ksh does)

				   9/27
				   ----
general.h
	- added defines for ABSPATH (absolute pathname), RELPATH (relative
	  pathname, and ROOTEDPATH (pathname rooted at /), with different
	  definitions for Unix and Cygwin
	- added defines for DIRSEP (the directory separator in pathnames,
	  and ISDIRSEP (whether a particular character is the directory
	  separator)
	- added PATHSEP define: takes a character and decides whether it
	  delimits a filename component of a pathname
	- changed isletter(c) #define to just call isalpha(c)

lib/sh/pathcanon.c
	- changed to use new pathname #defines from general.h above

general.c
	- changed make_absolute, absolute_pathname to understand
	  Cygwin's idea of an absolute pathname: [[:upper:][:lower:]]:/
	- rewrote absolute_pathname to use PATHSEP and ABSPATH
	- changed full_pathname to use ABSPATH

variables.c
	- changed get_bash_name to use ABSPATH and RELPATH, and to handle the
	  case when $PWD is unset when it is called

subst.c
	- if compiling on cygwin, translate \r\n to \n when reading the output
	  of a command substitution in read_comsub()

				   9/28
				   ----
input.c, shell.c, builtins/read.def, lib/tilde/tilde.c
	- changed __CYGWIN32__ to __CYGWIN__

lib/readline/{bind,funmap,kill}.c, lib/readline/readline.h
	- changed __CYGWIN32__ to __CYGWIN__

input.c
	- a couple of minor changes to clean up the code

parse.y
	- changed shell_getc and shell_ungetc to implement one character of
	  lookahead/lookbehind when pushing a character back at the start
	  of an input line (the old code would have discarded it because
	  shell_input_line_index was 0)

lib/readline{histsearch.c,history.h}
	- history_search_internal, history_search, history_search_prefix,
	  history_search_pos now take const char * string arguments

lib/readline/{histexpand.c,history.h}
	- get_history_event, history_arg_extract, history_tokenize_internal,
	  history_tokenize now take const char * string arguments

lib/readline/{history.c,history.h}
	- add_history, replace_history_entry now take const char * string
	  arguments

lib/readline/{bind.c,readline.h}
	- rl_add_defun, rl_unbind_command_in_map, rl_set_key, rl_macro_bind,
	  rl_generic_bind, rl_translate_keyseq, rl_named_function,
	  rl_function_of_keyseq, rl_variable_bind, rl_get_keymap_by_name
	  now take const char * string arguments where appropriate
	- rl_function_dumper, rl_list_funmap_names needed changes to deal
	  with rl_funmap_names returning const char **
	- rl_readline_name is now a const char * variable

lib/readline/keymaps.h
	- duplicate definition of rl_get_keymap_by_name needs const changes

lib/readline/{bind.c,rlprivate.h}
	- _rl_bind_if_unbound takes a const char * string argument

lib/readline/{funmap.c,readline.h}
	- rl_add_funmap_entry now takes a const char * string argument
	- rl_funmap_names now returns a const char **
	- a FUNMAP now has a const char *name member

lib/readline/{terminal.c,readline.h,rlprivate.h}
	- _rl_init_terminal_io, rl_get_termcap, rl_reset_terminal,
	  _rl_output_some_chars now take const char * string arguments

lib/readline/{readline.[ch],rlprivate.h}
	- rl_library_version and rl_terminal_name are now const char *
	  variables
	- rl_insert_text, _rl_replace_text now take const char * string
	  arguments

lib/readline/{callback.c,readline.h}
	- rl_callback_handler_install takes a const char * string argument

lib/readline/doc/{rltech,hstech}.texinfo
	- changed documentation for newly-consted functions and variables

lib/readline/{complete.c,readline.h}
	- rl_strpbrk now takes const char * string arguments
	- username_completion_function and filename_completion_function
	  now take const char * string arguments
	- rl_basic_word_break_characters, rl_basic_quote_characters,
	  rl_completer_word_break_characters, rl_completer_quote_characters,
	  rl_filename_quote_characters, rl_special_prefixes are all
	  const char * variables

lib/readline/{display.c,rlprivate.h}
	- _rl_move_cursor_relative takes a const char * string argument

redir.c
	- change from tbisp@uswest.net to fix a problem with cygwin and
	  here_document_to_fd, since cygwin doesn't allow a file to be
	  unlinked if there is a descriptor open on it

display.c
	- fixed a slight bug in the logic deciding whether or not to redraw
	  a prompt containing invisible characters in update_line.  Fixes
	  bug reported by bdluevel@heitec.net

				   9/29
				   ----
shell.c
	- fixed a problem with a too-aggressive setting of restricted shell
	  mode based on shell_name.  Old code set `restricted' even after a
	  longjmp due to shell_execve trying to execute an executable script
	  without a leading `#!', though that case should result in an
	  unrestricted shell

				   10/2
				   ----
copy_cmd.c
	- make sure copy_function_def copies the `flags' and `line' members
	  of the function_def

parse.y
	- make the function_def production take a new function_body parse
	  unit, which is currently just a group_command (in prep for future
	  changes)

builtins/printf.def
	- changed getint, getlong, getulong, getdouble to print warnings on
	  range errors and return the clamped values that strtol/strtod
	  return, as POSIX.2 specifies

				   10/3
				   ----
parse.y
	- made a function_def a `command' instead of a `shell_command'
	  This makes the grammar more closely resemble that supplied in
	  the POSIX.2 standard
	- made a `function_body' be like the function_body production in
	  the POSIX.2 standard.  This relaxes the restriction that the
	  body be composed of a group_command, but introduces a YACC
	  shift/reduce conflict

print_cmd.c
	- changes to named_function_string (for normal function printing)
	  and print_function_def (for printing function definitions embedded
	  in other commands) to print redirections that should be attached
	  to the function as a whole after the closing brace, because of
	  the changes to the parser

tests/func2.sub
	- tests for new function declarations whose bodies are not group
	  commands -- the command printing code still prints them with the
	  braces

				   10/4
				   ----
lib/sh/pathphys.c
	- new function, sh_physpath, resolves symlinks in pathname passed
	  as argument

builtins/cd.def
	- changed pwd_builtin to use sh_physpath if -P supplied or in
	  physical mode
	- changed bindpwd to use sh_physpath if the no_symlinks argument is
	  non-zero
	- changed change_to_directory to use sh_physpath and set
	  the_current_working_directory appropriately if the `nolinks'
	  argument is non-zero

				   10/5
				   ----
variables.c, bashline.c, builtins/cd.def
	- replaced calls to canonicalize_pathname with sh_canonpath

builtins/cd.def
	- rewrote change_to_directory to make it much shorter and simpler

command.h
	- added SUBSHELL_PIPE as possible flag value for subshell_environment

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_simple_command sets SUBSHELL_PIPE in subshell_environment
	  if the command has a pipe in or out

subst.c
	- don't reset pipeline_pgrp to shell_pgrp in command_substitute if
	  we're already in a pipline
	  ((subshell_environment & SUBSHELL_PIPE) != 0)

				   10/6
				   ----
subst.c 
	- change command_substitute to call setmode(fd, O_TEXT) on the pipe
	  file descriptor if __CYGWIN__ is defined; remove the other code
	  that converts CR/LF to LF on cygwin

				   10/9
				   ----
stringlib.c
	- change strcreplace() to make sure that RESIZE_MALLOCED_BUFFER is
	  called everywhere characters are added

				   10/11
				   -----
lib/sh/spell.c
	- new file, with the spelling correction code from builtins/cd.def

builtins/cd.def
	- a little surgery on cd_builtin, to make the structure clearer

				   10/12
				   -----
builtins/read.def
	- include fcntl.h and io.h on __CYGWIN__
	- set mode of fd 0 to O_TEXT if __CYGWIN__ and O_TEXT are both
	  defined

shell.c
	- in open_shell_script, set mode of fd opened to the shell script
	  to O_TEXT if __CYGWIN__ and O_TEXT are both defined

builtins/evalfile.c
	- changed the __CYGWIN__ code to call setmode(fd, O_TEXT) instead
	  of translating \r to \n after the read() returns

				   10/13
				   -----
lib/sh/strtrans.c, stringlib.c
	- moved ansicstr() from stringlib.c to new file lib/sh/strtrans.c
	- new function ansic_quote, to quote a string with $'...'

lib/sh/strindex.c, stringlib.c
	- moved strindex() from stringlib.c to new file lib/sh/strindex.c

lib/sh/Makefile.in
	- compile `shquote.c' in as part of the shell library
	- compile `strtrans.c' in as part of the shell library
	- compile `strindex.c' in as part of the shell library

Makefile.in
	- link with libsh before any of the readline libraries

builtins/common.c
	- removed the functions also appearing in lib/sh/shquote.c

externs.h, builtins/common.h
	- moved extern declarations for functions in lib/sh/shquote.c to
	  externs.h from builtins/common.h

variables.c
	- print_var_value (used in the output of `set') now calls
	  ansic_quote to quote the value, so any non-printable characters
	  are displayed

				   10/14
				   -----
syntax.h
	- new file, with definitions from shell.h having to do with shell
	  syntax, metacharacters, and quoting

parse.y
	- moved defines for shell metachars and other char class declarations
	  to syntax.h

shell.h
	- now includes syntax.h

Makefile.in,builtins/Makefile.in,lib/sh/Makefile.in
	- added syntax.h to appropriate dependency lists

				   10/16
				   -----
mksyntax.c
	- new program, to build a syntax table for the shell at compile time

Makefile.in
	- new generated file, syntax.c, generated by mksyntax

general.h
	- `digit(x)' is now just defined as `isdigit(x)'

syntax.h
	- now that we have sh_syntaxtab[], change the appropriate defines
	  to use it

parse.y, subst.c
	- change checks of member(c, slashify_in_quotes) to test
	  sh_syntaxtab[c] & CBSDQUOTE

builtins/set.def
	- corrected the help text for `unset', since PATH and IFS may be
	  unset

subst.c
	- changed explicit tests for shell special parameters using member()
	  or strchr() to test (sh_syntaxtab[c] & CSPECVAR) instead
	- changed some boilerplate calls to member() that test for validity
	  of various characters in the expansion process to macros for
	  efficiency

lib/sh/shquote.c
	- changed some of the functions to use checks against sh_syntaxtab[]
	  flag values

				   10/19
				   -----
findcmd.c
	- find_user_command_in_path no longer finds directories if the caller
	  specified FS_NODIRS in the flags argument.  This fixes the bug of
	  hashing directory names, at the loss of some information about
	  attempting to execute directories

builtins/hash.def
	- hash -p dirname name no longer puts directories into the hash table

				   10/26
				   -----
builtins/read.def
	- make sure that the last unwind-protect added is the one that calls
	  xfree(input_string), so that this is the top element on the
	  unwind-protect stack
	- if xrealloc() is called to increase the size of input_string, make
	  sure to remove the top element from the unwind-protect stack (the
	  old xfree) and add a new one, in case realloc() freed the original
	  input_string and allocated new space.  This fixes the bug of bash
	  crashing because it's trying to free already-freed memory if the
	  `read' is interrupted (reported by klausf@Pool.Informatik.RWTH-Aachen.DE)

				   10/27
				   -----
subst.c
	- fixed a problem in expand_word_list_internal so that
	  last_command_exit_value is set to 1 if a variable assignment fails
	  and a jump_to_top_level (DISCARD) is taken.  This fixes the problem
	  of assignment statements to read-only variables appearing to succeed
	  (though it always worked right in non-interactive posix-mode shells)

				   10/30
				   -----
lib/readline/readline.h
	- rl_completion_entry_function is now of type CPFunction *, since
	  that's the actual type that's used, and casting function pointers
	  of different types (which happened all the time as a result), is
	  problematic on some architectures

lib/readline/complete.c
	- changed entry function argument to gen_completion_matches to be of
	  type CPFunction *, since that's how it's used
	- changed variables that are completion entry function pointers to be
	  of type CPFunction *, removed problematic typecasts

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- documented type change for rl_completion_entry_func

lib/readline/rltypedefs.h
	- new file, with all the readline function typedefs

lib/readline/rltypedefs.h

	  an int
	- a KEYMAP_ENTRY now contains a pointer to an rl_command_func_t
	- new typedef, rl_compentry_func_t, which is a function returning
	  a char *

	- new typedef, rl_compignore_func_t, which is a function returning a
	  char *
	- new typedef, rl_compdisp_func_t, which is a void function taking
	  a char **, int, int argument list
	- new typedef, rl_hook_func_t, which is a function taking no args
	  and returning an int (used for input and other hooks)
	- new typedef, rl_modterm_func_t, which is a void function tkaing
	  an int, used to modify terminal (rl_prep_term_function)
	- new typedef, rl_getc_func_t, which is an int-returning function
	  that takes a FILE *
	- new typedef, rl_linebuf_func_t, which takes a string and an int
	  index and returns an int
	- new generic typedefs, rl_intfunc_t and rl_voidfunc_t, which are
	  functions which take and return int and void, respectively 
	- new generic typedef, rl_vintfunc_t, which takes an int and returns
	  void
	- new generic typedefs, rl_icpfunc_t and rl_vcpfunc_t, which take a
	  char * and return int and void, respectively
	- new generic typedefs, rl_icppfunc_t and rl_vcppfunc_t, which take

	  be written

support/config.{guess,sub}
	- added entries for MIPS-based Compaq machines running NonStopUX

				   11/1
				   ----
lib/readline/undo.c

	- maybe_{replace,save,unsave}_line function that call their rl_
	  counterparts
	- moved ding() here; it just calls rl_ding()
	- moved alphabetic here; it just calls _rl_alphabetic()

lib/readline/Makefile.in
	- make sure compat.o is built and linked appropriately

bashline.c,pcomplete.c
	- changed calls to ding() to call rl_ding()

support/shobj-conf
	- changed linux stanza SHLIB_XLDFLAGS to make the `soname' in a
	  shared library have only the major version number, rather than
	  major and minor numbers
	- made analogous changes for bsd/os-4
	- changed freebsd 3.x stanza to match `freebsdelf[3-9]*' for
	  FreeBSD elf systems and `freebsdaout[3-9]*' for FreeBSD
	  a.out systems (are there any?)

lib/readline/doc/{rluser,hsuser}.texinfo

				   11/6
				   ----
configure.in
	- bash can only link with an already-installed readline library whose
	  version is 4.2 or greater

variables.h
	- new variable attribiute, noassign, with its accompanying test macro,
	  noassign_p.  Completely internal, not user-settable

execute_cmd.c
	- treat noassign variables like readonly variables, except an attempt
	  to assign to them does not cause a non-interactive shell in POSIX
	  mode to abort

{subst,variables}.c,builtins/declare.def
	- attempts to assign to `noassign' variables return an error status,
	  but no error messages -- almost identical to readonly variables

variables.c
	- GROUPS and FUNCNAME are `noassign' variables, meaning assignment to
	  them is disallowed, but that they may be unset (in which case they
	  lose their special properties)

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- documented that assignments to GROUPS and FUNCNAME are disallowed
	  and return an error status

				   11/8
				   ----
lib/readline/{funmap.c,bind.c,rlprivate.h}
	- _rl_possible_{control,meta}_prefixes are now arrays of `const char *'
	  and are defined in bind.c, since that's where they're used

lib/readline/rltty.c
	- changed prepare_terminal_settings to take an `oldtio' argument
	  instead of `otio', which shadows the global declaration

lib/readline/bind.c
	- the `name' member of a parser_directive element is now a
	  `const char *'
	- the `name' member of a boolean_varlist element is now a

	- the `name' member of an assoc_list element is now a
	  `const char *'
	- the `name' member of an keymap_names element is now a
	  `const char *'

lib/readline/display.c
	- changed scope-local char * variable `temp' to `vtemp' because
	  there's already a function local variable named `temp' of a
	  different type (int) in rl_redisplay

lib/readline/util.c
	- pathname_alphabetic_chars is now `const char *'

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- the `tc_var' member of a _tc_string element is now a
	  `const char *'

lib/readline/histexpand.c
	- changed history_expand_internal to remove the duplicate local
	  declaration of `t' in the `s'/`&' case

lib/readline/histfile.c
	- in history_filename, `home' is now a `const char *'

lib/tilde/tilde.c
	- default_prefixes and default_suffixes are now arrays of
	  `const char *'

lib/readline/vi_mode.c
	- vi_motion and vi_texmod are now `const char *'

lib/readline/complete.c
	- simplified the conditional declaration of getpwent()

variables.[ch]
	- get_string_value now takes a `const char *' argument

				   11/10
				   -----
display.c
	- changes to expand_prompt and rl_redisplay to keep track of the number
	  of invisible characters on the first line of the prompt, in case it
	  takes up more than one physical line, and not all invisible chars are
	  on the first line
	- the code that determines the index into the line at which to wrap the
	  first line if the visible prompt length exceeds the screen width was
	  changed to use the number of invisible chars in the first physical
	  prompt line rather than the total number of invisible characters
	- changed redraw_prompt to save and restore prompt_invis_chars_first_line

subst.c
	- changed expand_string_internal to savestring() the string argument
	  to avoid possible doubly-freed memory on substitution errors
	- fixed expand_word_list_internal so that commands with assignment
	  statements preceding words that expand to nothing return a failure
	  status if one of the assignments fails; for example

		readonly TVAR
		TVAR=7 $ECHO $ABCDE
	- made sure that all cases of jump_to_top_level set
	  last_command_exit_value to something non-zero before jumping, since
	  they are by definition errors

builtins/evalstring.c
	- changed parse_and_execute to set last_result to EXECUTION_FAILURE
	  along with last_command_exit_value in the `DISPOSE' case of a
	  jump_to_top_level, since we can return this value in most
	  (interactive) circumstances

				   11/14
				   -----
general.c
	- fix legal_number so that it skips any trailing whitespace in its
	  string argument after strtol returns, since strtol does not

lib/readline/{complete.c,readline.h}
	- new function pointer, rl_directory_rewrite_hook, identical in effect
	  to rl_directory_completion_hook except that it does not modify what
	  is displayed when the possible completions are listed or inserted

bashline.c
	- changed tcsh_magic_space to try and insert a space closer to where
	  the point was originally, rather than always inserting it at the
	  end of the line

				   11/16
				   -----
jobs.c
	- fixed a bug that happened on cygwin systems that caused the jobs
	  table to fill up if a file sourced from an interactive shell ran
	  lots of jobs -- notify_and_cleanup() never called notify_of_job_status

subst.c
	- fixed pat_match to avoid infinite recursion on zero-length matches
	  from match_pattern

				11/17/2000
				----------
[bash-2.05-alpha1 released]

				   11/18
				   -----
support/shobj-conf
	- added GNU Hurd support, identical to linux

variables.c
	- cygwin systems don't use the exportstr stuff at all, so call
	  INVALIDATE_EXPORTSTR before testing var->exportstr, since just
	  blindly using the value_cell will break exported functions that
	  already have an exportstr set
	- when recomputing the exported value because valid_exportstr fails,
	  make sure to call named_function_string if the variable is a shell
	  function

				   11/20
				   -----
variables.c
	- removed call to valid_exportstr; the exportstr code has been
	  adequately debugged

lib/glob/fnmatch.c
	- reverted to the POSIX.2 behavior of using the current locale and
	  strcoll() to evaluate range expressions in bracket expressions

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- added note to Pattern Matching section emphasizing that the current
	  locale plays a part in evaluating range expressions within [...]

aclocal.m4
	- added an #include <unistd.h> to the test for posix sigaction
	  restarting interrupted system calls

support/config.guess
	- changes from Tim Mooney to support `letter version' releases of
	  Tru 64 Unix on the Alpha (e.g., 5.1a)

				   11/21
				   -----
lib/sh/pathphys.c
	- make sure MAXSYMLINKS is defined

aclocal.m4
	- changed BASH_CHECK_PWFUNCS to just use AC_EGREP_CPP on a file
	  that includes pwd.h and other header files, checking for getpwuid.
	  It #defines HAVE_GETPW_DECLS if the egrep succeeds

lib/readline/complete.c
	- provide extern declaration of getpwent if _POSIX_SOURCE is defined,
	  since most systems don't declare it in <pwd.h> unless _POSIX_SOURCE
	  is undefined

				   11/22
				   -----
input.c
	- fixed a small typo in the cygwin-specific code

doc/{bashref.texi,bash.1}
	- added some more explanatory text about the effect of the current
	  locale's collating order on range expressions within bracket
	  expressions

doc/bashref.texi, lib/readline/doc/{rltech,rluser,hstech}.texinfo
	- changed to use @env instead of @code for the names of environment
	  and shell variables in text (not in tables yet)

				   11/27
				   -----
configure.in
	- configure without the bash malloc on Interix

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- changed completion_matches() to rl_completion_matches()
	- changed filename_completion_function() to
	  rl_filename_completion_function()
	- changed username_completion_function() to
	  rl_username_completion_function()

lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- changed declaration of _rl_alphabetic to rl_alphabetic, since that's
	  what's used in the C files

support/bashbug.sh
	- Debian has /usr/bin/editor as a link to the system default editor;
	  make that one of the alternatives if $EDITOR is not set
	- if the OS provides mktemp(1) or tempfile(1), use those to create
	  the temp file for the bug report

lib/readline/{readline.[ch], callback.c}
	- new function, rl_set_prompt, called with prompt string as argument,
	  sets and, if necessary, expands rl_prompt

lib/readline/{complete.c,compat.c,readline.h}
	- rl_completion_matches now takes a `const char *' as its first
	  argument
	- compute_lcd_of_matches now takes a `const char *' as its third
	  argument

lib/readline/rltypedefs.h
	- a rl_completion_func_t now takes a `const char *' as its first
	  argument

lib/readline/Makefile.in
	- added dependencies on rltypedefs.h

bashline.c
	- attempt_shell_completion now takes a `const char *' as its first
	  argument
	- removed bogus cast when assigning to rl_attempted_completion_function
	  and rl_completion_entry_function
	- bash_directory_completion_matches takes a `const char *' argument

pcomplete.c
	- gen_matches_from_itemlist, pcomp_filename_completion_function,
	  gen_action_completions, gen_globpat_matches, gen_wordlist_matches,
	  gen_compspec_completions now take `const char *' arguments as
	  appropriate
	- programmable_completions now takes `const char *' first and 
	  second arguments

pcomplib.c
	- find_compspec now takes a `const char *' argument

				   11/29
				   -----
shell.c
	- in open_shell_script, if we have /dev/fd, don't perform the check
	  for a binary file if isatty(fd) (where fd is opened on the script
	  name) returns non-zero
	- in open_shell_script, don't call init_noninteractive again, since it
	  can undo changes made by the startup files ($BASH_ENV)

input.c
	- in fd_to_buffered_stream, make sure buffer size (and hence size
	  arg passed to read(2)) is greater than zero.  This makes
	  bash /dev/stdin work right.
	- return -1 from sync_buffered_stream immediately if buffers is NULL
	  (can happen when running `bash -i /dev/stdin' and executing a
	  command that requires a fork)

				   11/30
				   -----
jobs.c
	- renamed cont_signal_handler to sigcont_sighandler for consistency
	- renamed stop_signal_handler to sigstop_sighandler for consistency
	- if there is no jobs list or no outstanding jobs, return immediately
	  from notify_of_job_status, before fussing with the signal state
	- change map_over_jobs to not fuss with the signal state unless there
	  are jobs

lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- encapsulated the code to block and unblock signals during morecore()
	  execution into two functions:  block_signals and unblock_signals
	- only block signals in morecore() if interrupt_immediately is non-zero
	  or SIGINT or SIGCHLD is trapped

				   12/1
				   ----
lib/readline/readline.c
	- fix to rl_forward to make sure that lend doesn't get set < 0, since
	  that will result in rl_point being < 0

				   12/5
				   ----
parse.y
	- fix to parse_matched_pair to allow backslash to escape a ' inside a
	  $'...' construct inside another grouping construct like ${...}
	- translate $'...' and $"..." in parse_matched_pair, because nothing
	  else will do it if such a construct appears inside a grouping
	  construct

				   12/6
				   ----
configure.in
	- make sure all bracket tests for pattern matching in case statements
	  are appropriately quoted, so autoconf doesn't swallow the brackets
	- add -rdynamic to LOCAL_LDFLAGS for freebsd-4.x

examples/loadables/realpath.c
	- new loadable builtin, canonicalizes pathnames and expands symlinks

builtins/ulimit.def
	- added undocumented -w option for setting RLIMIT_SWAP, if it's defined

				   12/7
				   ----
bashline.c
	- reordered code in initialize_readline so all of the rl_add_defun
	  calls are made before the call to rl_initialize, and all of the
	  rl_{bind,unbind}_key_in_map calls are made after initializing
	  readline.  This allows the bash-specific function names to be used
	  in ~/.inputrc

				   12/12
				   -----
lib/readline/callback.c
	- in rl_callback_read_char, loop after returning from
	  readline_internal_char and test rl_pending_input in case some
	  function (like the incremental search functions and digit argument
	  functions) pushed input back with rl_execute_next

lib/readline/readline.h
	- new rl_state flag:  RL_STATE_INPUTPENDING, indicating that
	  rl_execute_next has pushed input back for rl_get_key to read

lib/readline/input.c
	- new function to clear rl_pending_input: rl_clear_pending_input()

lib/readline/{input,readline,signals}.c
	- when rl_pending_input is set, set state RL_STATE_INPUTPENDING;
	  unset that state when rl_read_key returns the pending input
	- call rl_clear_pending_input at appropriate points

				   12/15
				   -----
lib/readline/histfile.c
	- don't leak file descriptors while attempting to truncate a non-regular
	  file

input.c
	- make sure check_bash_input sets the close-on-exec flag for the file
	  descriptor used to save the bash input fd

parse.y
	- if default_buffered_input gets changed while it's on the saved
	  stream stack, make sure it gets set to close-on-exec when it's
	  restored by pop_stream()

				   12/18
				   -----
builtins/ulimit.def
	- change set_limit to account for Cygwin's setdtablesize() being
	  declared as a void function

support/config.{guess,sub}
	- change cygwin32 to cygwin

				   12/20
				   -----
nojobs.c
	- make wait_sigint_handler handle the case of interrupt_immediately
	  being non-zero when it's called, and jump out appropriately

jobs.c
	- new function to run sigchld traps: run_sigchld_trap(); called from
	  waitchld
	- broke the code that computes the printable job status messages for
	  pretty_print_job out into a separate function
	- rearranged some code eliminating a useless `else' branch in wait_for
	- shell_tty_info is now a TTYSTRUCT, using defines from shtty.h
	- broke the code that sets a job's status after waitpid says its state
	  has changed and cleans up after a received SIGINT out into a separate
	  function: set_job_status_and_cleanup
	- last_stopped_job() -> job_last_stopped() to avoid collision with a
	  variable name
	- last_running_job() -> job_last_running() for consistency

				   12/21
				   -----
variables.c
	- new function, print_func_list (SHELL_VAR **list); prints shell
	  functions from list in a form that may be re-used as input to
	  redefine the functions

variables.h
	- new extern declaration for print_func_list

builtins/set.def
	- set without options now calls print_func_list to have functions
	  printed in a way that can be reused as input (this affects
	  `declare' and `declare -p' also)

				   12/27
				   -----
general.h
	- add an ISOCTAL define

builtins/common.h
	- use ISOCTAL in read_octal function

parse.y
	- in decode_prompt_string, don't just skip STRING forward by 3 if an
	  octal sequence is translated; handle sequences of fewer than three
	  characters by checking each character

				   12/28
				   -----
doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- make sure `vi-move' is a documented keymap argument to bind's
	  `-m' option

				   12/29
				   -----
variables.c
	- change print_assignment so that functions are printed in a way that
	  may be reused as input (without the `=')

				 1/2/2001
				 --------
test.c
	- fix test_command to print an error message if `[' is supplied a
	  single argument that is not `]'

support/shobj-conf
	- change test of $SHOBJ_CC from `gcc*' to `*gcc*' to handle full
	  pathnames

				   1/11
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- in initialize_subshell, zero out builtin_env, since those aren't
	  supposed to be exported

variables.c
	- new function: shell_var_from_env_string, creates a SHELL_VAR from
	  a `name=value' style environment string and returns it
	- new function: bind_name_in_env_array(name, value, array), makes
	  NAME have VALUE in ARRAY, a temporary environment
	- new function: bind_tempenv_variable (name, value), makes NAME have
	  VALUE in one of the temporary environments -- temporary_env,
	  builtin_env, or function_env
	- changed bind_variable to call bind_tempenv_variable if one of the
	  temporary environments is non-null before modifying the
	  shell_variables table.  This fixes a problem with sourced scripts
	  modifying variables in a temporary environment, but not seeing the
	  updated values

				   1/12
				   ----
variables.c
	- changed things so OSTYPE, HOSTTYPE, and MACHTYPE are set only if
	  they don't have a value at shell startup

				   1/17
				   ----
builtins/fc.def
	- create temp file with MT_USETMPDIR

variables.c
	- allow function local readonly variables to overwrite (or shadow)
	  other (calling) function readonly variables, but not global
	  readonly ones

builtins/wait.def
	- replace unwind_protect of interrupt_immediately, since that's a
	  variable that you cannot unwind-protect (the unwind-protect code
	  uses it)

				   1/22
				   ----
Makefile.in
	- changed RELSTATUS to `beta1'

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- added rl_set_screen_size function, wrapper around
	  _rl_set_screen_size so bash doesn't call _rl_ functions

lib/readline/{rlprivate,readline}.h
	- moved rl_explicit_arg to readline.h
	- moved rl_numeric_arg to readline.h
	- moved rl_editing_mode to readline.h
	- moved rl_last_func to readline.h
	- added rl_set_screen_size to readline.h

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- documented rl_explicit_arg, rl_editing_mode, rl_numeric_arg,
	  rl_last_func
	- documented rl_set_screen_size

{jobs,nojobs}.c
	- _rl_set_screen_size -> rl_set_screen_size

{bashline,pcomplete}.c, builtins/set.def
	- removed extern declarations of variables defined in readline.h

				   1/23
				   ----
support/rlvers.sh
	- use $TMPDIR if it's defined
	- use $RL_INCDIR (set by -I option, /usr/local/include by default)
	  as the directory containing the installed readline header files
	- cd to the temp directory before attempting compilation

configure.in
	- pass `-I ${includedir}' to rlvers.sh

				   1/29
				   ----
subst.c
	- fixed parameter_brace_expand to only throw away the state of
	  quoted dollar-at if we're going to be using the rhs of the
	  brace expansion, since whatever parameter_brace_expand_rhs sets
	  should be what goes (corrects bad fix of 2/16/2000)
	- fixed param_expand to only free temp after calling
	  parameter_brace_expand if it's a quoted null and we *did not*
	  have a quoted $@, since in that case we want to keep it and
	  do the $@ special handling (fixes real problem from 2/16/2000)

				   1/30
				   ----
variables.c
	- remove export attribute from SSH2_CLIENT, like SSH_CLIENT

				    2/1
				    ---
unwind_prot.c
	- added new function, clear_unwind_protect_list, to zero out the
	  unwind_protect list, optionally freeing the elements

unwind_prot.h
	- new extern declaration for clear_unwind_protect_list

execute_cmd.c
	- call clear_unwind_protect_list in initialize_subshell.  This fixes
	  the problem of core dumps when calling a shell script without a
	  leading `#!' from a shell function or other context with an
	  unwind-protect list
	- set variable_context and return_catch_flag to 0 in
	  initialize_subshell, since a new subshell is no longer in a shell
	  function

				    2/2
				    ---
doc/readline.3
	- updated the text; clarified several points
	- changed the usage synopsis to include <readline/readline.h> and
	  <readline/history.h>

lib/readline/doc/hstech.texinfo
	- made sure all function prototypes are valid ANSI C (mostly
	  changing () to (void))

lib/readline/doc/rluser.texinfo
	- a few clarifications

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- a few clarifications
	- added two new subsections for character input and terminal
	  management
	- changed all function prototypes to be valid ANSI C (mostly
	  replacing () with (void))
	- documented some variables in readline.h but previously not in
	  the reference manual (rl_num_chars_to_read, rl_dispatching,
	  rl_gnu_readline_p, rl_completion_type)
	- documented some functions in readline.h but previously not in
	  the reference manual (rl_clear_pending_input, rl_prep_terminal,
	  rl_deprep_terminal, rl_tty_set_default_bindings, rl_alphabetic,
	  rl_crlf)

lib/readline/readline.h
	- added extern declaration for rl_clear_pending_input()
	- added extern declaration for rl_alphabetic
	- changed rltty_set_default_bindings to rl_tty_set_default_bindings
	- changed crlf() -> rl_crlf()

lib/readline/rltty.c
	- new function, rl_tty_set_default_bindings, just calls
	  rltty_set_default_bindings (needed `rl_' prefix)

lib/readline/readline.c
	- readline_default_bindings now calls rl_tty_set_default_bindings

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- renamed crlf() to rl_crlf(); crlf() is still defined for backwards
	  compatibility 

bashline.c, lib/readline/{complete,display}.c
	- changed all calls to crlf() to rl_crlf()

test.c
	- fix filecomp() so that `test file1 -nt file2' doesn't fail if file1
	  exists but file2 does not

				    2/5
				    ---
lib/readline/{terminal,compat}.c
	- move crlf() backwards-compatibility definition to compat.c

execute_cmd.c
	- if we're running a command `( command ) &' from a non-interactive
	  shell, don't unconditionally disable expand_aliases.  Only do it
	  when running such a command from an interactive shell, since then
	  we're changing to a non-interactive shell

				    2/6
				    ---
[bash-2.05-beta1 released]

lib/readline/compat.c
	- add extern declaration for rl_crlf()

lib/readline/undo.c
	- initialize start and end in rl_do_undo to avoid bogus gcc compiler
	  warning with -Wall

lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- fix typo in extern declaration of _rl_current_display_line()
	- add extern declaration of _rl_free_saved_history_line()

lib/readline/terminal.c
	- return immediately from _rl_set_screen_size if one of the args is 0
	- new function, rl_get_screen_size (int *rows, int *cols) to return
	  readline's idea of the screen dimensions

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- documented rl_get_screen_size

				    2/7
				    ---
pathexp.c
	- a couple of fixes for the POSIX_GLOB_LIBRARY version of the globbing
	  code

expr.c
	- fixed omission of ^= from the special assignment operators

shell.c
	- change logic for setting `posixly_correct' at shell startup:  if
	  $POSIXLY_CORRECT or $POSIX_PEDANTIC is found in the environment,
	  set it to 1, otherwise retain the previous value (which is
	  initialized to 0)

				   2/10
				   ----
builtins/evalstring.c
	- since subshell_environment is now a flags word, test for the
	  SUBSHELL_COMSUB bit being set when decided whether or not to
	  evaluate $(<file), not just for subshell_environment ==
	  SUBSHELL_COMSUB

				   2/12
				   ----
lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- fixed a couple of problems with the documentation for
	  rl_prep_terminal and rl_deprep_terminal 
	- added description of rl_set_prompt

support/config.sub
	- added support for Linux running on the IBM S390

				   2/13
				   ----
input.c
	- new function, fd_is_bash_input (fd), encapsulates the test for
	  whether or not FD is the file descriptor from which bash is reading
	  its input
	- change check_bash_input to call fd_is_bash_input
	- new function, save_bash_input (fd, new_fd), handles saving the
	  buffered stream associated with file descriptor FD to one
	  associated with NEW_FD.  If NEW_FD == -1, this function allocates a
	  file descriptor itself with fcntl
	- new function, set_bash_input_fd(fd), sets the fd bash is using to
	  read input to FD
	- changed duplicate_buffered_stream to note that the buffer it's
	  duplicating to was the bash input buffer (B_WASBASHINPUT)

input.h
	- extern declarations for fd_is_bash_input and save_bash_input
	- new flag for b->flag: B_WASBASHINPUT

redir.c
	- in add_undo_redirect, if FD is 0, make the undo redirect be of type
	  r_duplicating_input instead of r_duplicating_output, since that fd
	  requires special handling in the presence of buffered streams (fixes
	  problem with scripts reading input through a pipe restoring bash
	  input buffered stream correctly after a `read' with an input
	  redirection

				   2/14
				   ----
lib/readline{complete,util}.c
	- moved rl_strpbrk to util.c with rest of string utility functions,
	  renamed to _rl_strpbrk

lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- extern declaration for _rl_strpbrk

lib/readline/input.c
	- make the timeout in rl_gather_tyi() be a variable
	  (_keyboard_input_timeout) rather than a constant
	- new function, rl_set_keyboard_input_timeout (int u) to set
	  _keyboard_input_timeout.  The argument is in microseconds; returns
	  the old value of _keyboard_input_timeout
	- _rl_input_available uses _keyboard_input_timeout also

lib/readline/readline.h
	- extern declaration for rl_set_keyboard_input_timeout

lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- documented rl_variable_bind(), rl_macro_bind(), rl_macro_dumper(),
	  rl_variable_dumper(), rl_push_macro_input(), rl_show_char()

				   2/20
				   ----
findcmd.c
	- new function, executable_or_directory(name), returns 1 if NAME is
	  an executable file or a directory

findcmd.h
	- extern declaration for executable_or_directory()

bashline.c
	- call executable_or_directory() from command_word_completion_function,
	  which requires a single stat(2), instead of executable_file() and
	  is_directory(), each of which requires a stat(2)

				   2/21
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- changed execute_builtin to handle `return' with a preceding variable
	  assignment list specially when in POSIX mode.  POSIX says that the
	  variable assignments should persist after the builtin returns, since
	  `return' is a special builtin.  Since `return' does a longjmp and
	  doesn't go through the normal cleanup path, we need to do special
	  things

variables.c
	- new function, merge_function_env(), merges the function_env into
	  the shell_variables table

variables.h
	- extern declaration for merge_function_env()

execute_cmd.c
	- changed execute_function to merge any variable assignments preceding
	  the function call into shell_variables if the shell is running in
	  POSIX mode

subst.c
	- changed parameter_brace_expand_error to do tilde expansion on the
	  rhs of the expansion, if it's not null
	- changed command_substitute so that the subshell begun to execute
	  the command substitution inherits the setting of the `-e' option
	  when in POSIX mode

builtins/break.def
	- changed check_loop_level to not print a complaining message when
	  the shell is running in POSIX mode, even if BREAK_COMPLAINS is
	  defined.  This affects `break' and `continue'
	- changed `break' and `continue' to return success even if the shell
	  is not executing a loop, as POSIX specifies

builtins/set.def
	- changed reset_shell_options() to not clear posixly_correct, so
	  subshells spawned to execute shell scripts without a leading `#!'
	  inherit posix mode from their parent shell

variables.c
	- changed make_new_variable to create the shell_variables hash table
	  if it hasn't been done yet.  This is needed because bind_variable
	  may be called before initialize_shell_variables (e.g., when
	  `bash -o posix' calls bind_variable("POSIXLY_CORRECT", "y") from
	  parse_shell_options -> set_minus_o_option -> set_posix_mode
	  This makes `bash --posix' and `bash -o posix' equivalent, as they
	  should always have been
	- changed maybe_make_export_env to merge the contents of `builtin_env'
	  into export_env after function_env and before temporary_env.  This
	  fixes the problems with variable assignments preceding `eval' or
	  `source' not making it into the environment passed to executed disk
	  commands (var=20 eval printenv var)

doc/bashref.texi
	- noted that variable assignments preceding shell function calls
	  persist in the shell environment after the function returns when
	  the shell is running in POSIX mode
	- noted that when the shell is running in POSIX mode, subshells
	  spawned to execute command substitutions inherit the value of
	  the `-e' option from the parent shell

				   2/26
				   ----
doc/bashref.texi
	- augmented description of bash non-posix behavior in posix mode
	  with information from running the vsc-lite test suite

				   2/28
				   ----
general.c
	- since POSIX.2 says that aliases should be expanded even in
	  non-interactive shells, enable alias expansion in
	  posix_initialize() when posix mode is enabled, and set it to the
	  value of interactive_shell if posix mode is disabled

shell.c
	- before running the startup scripts, set expand_aliases to
	  posixly_correct, since we don't want alias expansion in startup
	  files unless we've been given the --posix invocation option

doc/bashref.texi
	- added item in BASH Posix Mode section noting that alias expansion
	  is always enabled when in posix mode

Makefile.in
	- changed release level to `beta2'

				    3/1
				    ---
jobs.c
	- expanded retcode_name_buffer to 64
	- changed printable_job_status to conform to posix.2 for text of
	  stopped job status: `Stopped(SIGTSTP)' or `Stopped(SIGSTOP)'

doc/bashref.texi
	- Noted above change in posix mode section

				    3/5
				    ---
lib/readline/bind.c
	- changed rl_get_keymap_by_name to work case-insensitively

				    3/6
				    ---
doc/readline.{0,3,ps}
	- removed from distribution; moved to readline distribution

lib/readline/doc/history.3
	- man page for history library; neither built nor installed
	  (part of the standalone readline distribution)

lib/readline/histfile.c
	- changed history_truncate_file to return 0 on success, errno
	  on failure
	- changed history_do_write to return errno on a write error.  This
	  affects write_history and append_history

lib/readline/history.c
	- max_input_history is now history_max_entries; the old variable is
	  maintained for backwards compatibility

lib/readline/histexpand.c
	- the list of delimiters that separate words for history_tokenize
	  is now a variable: history_word_delimiters; default value is as
	  before
	- changed history_expand to return 0 immediately if its second
	  argument is NULL

bashline.c
	- changed to use history_max_entries

lib/readline/history.h
	- extern declaration for history_max_entries
	- extern declaration for history_word_delimiters

				    3/8
				    ---
test.c
	- changed unary_operator() to return FALSE for non-numeric arguments
	  to `-t'

				    3/9
				    ---
[bash-2.05-beta2 released]

				   3/12
				   ----
lib/readline/doc/rltech.texinfo
	- documented rl_set_paren_blink_timeout()
	- moved the example function to its own info node

lib/readline/{hstech.texinfo,history.3}
	- `$' is not in the default value of history_word_delimiters

				   3/13
				   ----
bashline.c
	- in maybe_add_history, if the tests for HISTCONTROL succeed, but
	  the HISTIGNORE check fails, set first_line_saved to 0

				   3/15
				   ----

lib/glob/fnmatch.c
	- fixed a bug in patscan that caused `[' to be treated as special
	  even inside a nested bracket expression.  It's supposed to lose
	  it's special handling inside []
	- fixed a bug in patscan that caused `]' to end an embedded bracket
	  expression even if it was the first character after the `[' (or
	  a leading `!' or `^')

				   3/22
				   ----
execute_cmd.c
	- made a small change to shell_execve to report a more user-friendly
	  error if execve(2) fails because of a `#! interpreter' error with
	  `interpreter'
	- in shell_execve, if HAVE_HASH_BANG_EXEC is not defined, make sure
	  the file length is > 2 characters before attempting to execute an
	  interpreter

				   3/26
				   ----
jobs.c, nojobs.c
	- give_terminal_to now takes a second argument, FORCE.  If that
	  second argument is non-zero, give the terminal away no matter
	  what job_control is set to

jobs.h
	- changed extern declaration of give_terminal_to

{jobs,sig,subst}.c,parse.y
	- changed all calls to give_terminal_to to add a second argument
	  of 0

jobs.c
	- changed second argument of call to give_terminal_to in
	  end_job_control to 1, to force this even if job_control is 0.
	  This fixes the problem of `exec other-job-control-shell' in a
	  startup file hanging, since run_startup_files sets job_control to 0

subst.c
	- fixed test of subshell_environment in command_substitute to test the
	  bit SUBSHELL_ASYNC rather than test equality, since it's now a
	  bitmask

				   3/27
				   ----
shell.c
	- changed posix initialization calls to set POSIXLY_CORRECT=y and
	  then call sv_strict_posix, so $SHELLOPTS includes `posix' and
	  POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, for both the posix command line options
	  and when act_like_sh is non-zero

redir.c
	- the `>& filename' redirection now works in posix mode, redirecting
	  stdout and stderr, since POSIX.2 leaves it unspecified

doc/bashref.texi
	- removed item about `>& filename' from Bash POSIX Mode section

parse.y
	- fixed a problem in decode_prompt_string with `\W' not printing
	  anything if PWD == "//"

lib/readline/input.c
	- in rl_read_key, after calling (*rl_event_hook), check for rl_done
	  being set, and return '\n' if it is

Makefile.in
	- changed RELSTATUS to `release'

				   3/28
				   ----
support/bashbug.sh
	- replace use of $(...) with `...` for the benefit of old versions
	  of sh

builtins/set.def
	- changed print_all_shell_variables to not print shell function names
	  and definitions when in posix mode

doc/bashref.texi
	- noted change in `set' behavior in posix mode section

				    4/2
				    ---
lib/readline/readline.c
	- changed default value of RL_LIBRARY_VERSION to `4.2'

				    4/5
				    ---
[bash-2.05-release frozen]

				    4/6
				    ---
bashline.c
	- fix to vi_edit_and_execute_command to keep it from adding an
	  empty line to the history and not resetting current_command_line_count,
	  which resulted in each command re-run with `v' having a `;' appended
