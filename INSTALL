Basic Installation
==================

These are installation instructions for Bash.

The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package
(the top directory, the `builtins' and `doc' directories, and the each
directory under `lib').  It also creates a `config.h' file containing
system-dependent definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script named
`config.status' that you can run in the future to recreate the current
configuration, a file `config.cache' that saves the results of its
tests to speed up reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing
compiler output (useful mainly for debugging `configure').  If at some
point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you may
remove or edit it.

If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try to
figure out how `configure' could check whether or not to do them, and
mail diffs or instructions to `bash-maintainers@prep.ai.mit.edu' so
they can be considered for the next release.

The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called Autoconf.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change it
or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of Autoconf.  If you do
this, make sure you are using Autoconf version 2.10 or newer.

If you need to change `configure.in' or regenerate `configure', you
will need to create two files: `_distribution' and `_patchlevel'.
`_distribution' should contain the major and minor version numbers of
the Bash distribution, for example `2.01'.  `_patchlevel' should
contain the patch level of the Bash distribution, `0' for example.  The
script `support/mkconffiles' has been provided to automate the creation
of these files.

The simplest way to compile Bash is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the source code and type
     `./configure' to configure Bash for your system.  If you're using
     `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type `sh
     ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile Bash and build the `bashbug' bug reporting
     script.

  3. Optionally, type `make tests' to run the Bash test suite.

  4. Type `make install' to install `bash' and `bashbug'.  This will
     also install the manual pages and Info file.

You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source
code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the files that
`configure' created (so you can compile Bash for a different kind of
computer), type `make distclean'.

Compilers and Options
=====================

Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:

     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

On systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:

     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

The configuration process uses GCC to build Bash if it is available.

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

You can compile Bash for more than one kind of computer at the same
time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their own
directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that supports
the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the directory where
you want the object files and executables to go and run the `configure'
script from the source directory.  You may need to supply the
`--srcdir=PATH' argument to tell `configure' where the source files
are.  `configure' automatically checks for the source code in the
directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
variable, you can compile Bash for one architecture at a time in the
source code directory.  After you have installed Bash for one
architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
architecture.

Alternatively, if your system supports symbolic links, you can use the
`support/mkclone' script to create a build tree which has symbolic
links back to each file in the source directory.  Here's an example
that creates a build directory in the current directory from a source
directory `/usr/gnu/src/bash-2.0':

     bash /usr/gnu/src/bash-2.0/support/mkclone -s /usr/gnu/src/bash-2.0 .

The `mkclone' script requires Bash, so you must have already built Bash
for at least one architecture before you can create build directories
for other architectures.

Installation Names
==================

By default, `make install' will install into `/usr/local/bin',
`/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an installation prefix other
than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the option `--prefix=PATH'.

You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
`PATH' as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
`--host=TYPE' option.  `TYPE' can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
`CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM' (e.g., `sparc-sun-sunos4.1.2').

See the file `support/config.sub' for the possible values of each field.

Sharing Defaults
================

If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share, you
can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives default
values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.  `configure'
looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: the Bash `configure' looks for a site script, but not all
`configure' scripts do.

Operation Controls
==================

`configure' recognizes the following options to control how it operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the Bash source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely used, boilerplate
options.

Optional Features
=================

The Bash `configure' has a number of `--enable-FEATURE' options, where
FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.  There are also
several `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE is something like
`gnu-malloc' or `purify' (for the Purify memory allocation checker).  To
turn off the default use of a package, use `--without-PACKAGE'.  To
configure Bash without a feature that is enabled by default, use
`--disable-FEATURE'.

Here is a complete list of the `--enable-' and `--with-' options that
the Bash `configure' recognizes.

`--with-afs'
     Define if you are using the Andrew File System from Transarc.

`--with-curses'
     Use the curses library instead of the termcap library.  This should
     be supplied if your system has an inadequate or incomplete termcap
     database.

`--with-glibc-malloc'
     Use the GNU libc version of `malloc' in `lib/malloc/gmalloc.c'.
     This is somewhat slower than the default `malloc', but wastes
     considerably less space.

`--with-gnu-malloc'
     Use the GNU version of `malloc' in `lib/malloc/malloc.c'.  This is
     not the same `malloc' that appears in GNU libc, but an older
     version derived from the 4.2 BSD `malloc'.  This `malloc' is very
     fast, but wastes a lot of space.  This option is enabled by
     default.  The `NOTES' file contains a list of systems for which
     this should be turned off, and `configure' disables this option
     automatically for a number of systems.

`--with-purify'
     Define this to use the Purify memory allocation checker from Pure
     Software.

`--enable-minimal-config'
     This produces a shell with minimal features, close to the
     historical Bourne shell.

The `minimal-config' option can be used to disable all of the following
options, but it is processed first, so individual options may be
enabled using `enable-FEATURE'.

All of the following options except for `disabled-builtins' and
`usg-echo-default' are enabled by default, unless the operating system
does not provide the necessary support.

`--enable-alias'
     Allow alias expansion and include the `alias' and `unalias'
     builtins.

`--enable-array-variables'
     Include support for one-dimensional array shell variables.

`--enable-bang-history'
     Include support for `csh'-like history substitution.

`--enable-brace-expansion'
     Include `csh'-like brace expansion ( `b{a,b}c' ==> `bac bbc' ).

`--enable-command-timing'
     Include support for recognizing `time' as a reserved word and for
     displaying timing statistics for the pipeline following `time'.
     This allows pipelines as well as shell builtins and functions to
     be timed.

`--enable-directory-stack'
     Include support for a `csh'-like directory stack and the `pushd',
     `popd', and `dirs' builtins.

`--enable-disabled-builtins'
     Allow builtin commands to be invoked via `builtin xxx' even after
     `xxx' has been disabled using `enable -n xxx'.  See *Note Bash
     Builtins::, for details of the `builtin' and `enable' builtin
     commands.

`--enable-dparen-arithmetic'
     Include support for the `ksh' `((...))' command.

`--enable-help-builtin'
     Include the `help' builtin, which displays help on shell builtins
     and variables.

`--enable-history'
     Include command history and the `fc' and `history' builtin
     commands.

`--enable-job-control'
     This enables job control features, if the OS supports them.

`--enable-process-substitution'
     This enables process substitution (*note Process Substitution::.)
     if the OS provides the necessary support.

`--enable-prompt-string-decoding'
     Turn on the interpretation of a number of backslash-escaped
     characters in the `$PS1', `$PS2', `$PS3', and `$PS4' prompt
     strings.

`--enable-readline'
     Include support for command-line editing and history with the Bash
     version of the Readline library.

`--enable-restricted'
     Include support for a "restricted shell".  If this is enabled,
     Bash, when called as `rbash', enters a restricted mode.  See *Note
     The Restricted Shell::, for a description of restricted mode.

`--enable-select'
     Include the `ksh' `select' builtin, which allows the generation of
     simple menus.

`--enable-usg-echo-default'
     Make the `echo' builtin expand backslash-escaped characters by
     default, without requiring the `-e' option.  This makes the Bash
     `echo' behave more like the System V version.

The file `config.h.top' contains C Preprocessor `#define' statements
for options which are not settable from `configure'.  Some of these are
not meant to be changed; beware of the consequences if you do.  Read
the comments associated with each definition for more information about
its effect.
